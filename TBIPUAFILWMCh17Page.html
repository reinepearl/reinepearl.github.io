								Due to the loud ambient noises, Fu Shijun went near Su Zui’s ears and asked in a low voice: “Then let’s go?”
<br/><br/>
His small friend’s mood had already been coaxed better. This play doesn’t need to be further watched.
<br/><br/>
The remaining were all social niceties. Not only was it boring, it was also tiring.
<br/><br/>
When Fu Shijun got close, his body’s smell also pressed in, as if it was about to wrap him up.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui moved his brain away a bit and calmly said: “En.”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Thus, Fu Shijun got up to say his goodbyes.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijin heard that they were leaving and followed them: “I——”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun immediately interrupted him: “You work properly.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing’s eyes were full of hot tears as he watched them leave: “......”
 <br/><br/>
No, social niceties weren’t anything. Since he wasn’t working for real, he doesn’t need to maintain an elitist persona. He only needed to close his eyes and talk big with other people.
<br/><br/>
He was afraid that if he stayed here for a bit, he will be bumped porcelain by that mother and daughter pair, who were always using a strange expression to look at him!
<br/><br/>
He already performed such shameless thing for Fu Shijun. How can Fu Shijun just throw him away after using him? Without a single regard whether he will live or die?
<br/><br/>
That’s right. As a big emotionless demon king, Fu Shijun can be this selfish.
<br/><br/>
In actuality, this throwing away after being used was Fu Shijun’s real attitude towards people. He wasn’t actually targeting Fu Shijing.
<br/><br/>
Usually, Fu Shijing was used to it and doesn’t feel anything.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
But today, there was Su Zui who had received Fu Shijun’s consideration.
<br/><br/>
With this obvious comparison, Fu Shijing cannot help but feel that he received a completely inhuman treatment.
<br/><br/>
How was this being a big brother to the other? Even if Su Zui was the younger brother, he would still regard him highly! Actually, his real position might be his grandson......
<br/><br/>
Yet, even if Fu Shijing pretended to be the grandson, it was no use. Fu Shijun won’t compromise a single bit when he became callous.
<br/><br/>
He can only be left behind and mutually harm each other with the mother and daughter pair.
<br/><br/>
Hence, for the remaining time, because of the strong disequilibrium in his heart, Fu Shijing had an ugly face from the beginning to end.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
In the car.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui stared blankly at that 40% mission completion status.
<br/><br/>
[In the days that you haven’t seen each other, due to strong longing, boss’s love for you have increased day by day. Congratulations to small cannon fodder for skillfully used the distance makes the heart grow fonder method and firmly gripped the boss’s maiden heart! The days of taking the boss in for marriage is already very close! We asked small cannon fodder to not be overly proud and continue to persist! Being a winner in life aura is already sitting in your hands!]
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
Distance makes the heart grow fonder and persist your mother<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>. 
<br/><br/>
He never thought that Fu Shijun actually eat this set.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
This used to being in control male, after being given the cold shoulder, shouldn’t he easily turned his head and walk away?
<br/><br/>
How can he, en, like being dangled by others......
<br/><br/>
Su Zui still doesn’t understand that emotions completely do not follow common sense.
<br/><br/>
Actually, even the strongest person can be dominated once emotions came into play.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun put his hands on the steering wheel and tilted his head: “Should we find a place to eat? There wasn’t anything to eat just now.”
 <br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his eyes to look at Fu Shijun for a while.
<br/><br/>
The man’s face still had that indifferent expression. His eyes were dark. When he looked at him, it didn’t contain any hazy desire.
 <br/><br/>
At most, there was only a faint hint of worry.
<br/><br/>
If Fu Shijun was to directly chase him, there may be a change he could have unhesitatingly rejected him.
<br/><br/>
But with Fu Shijun acting as a silent admirer without a step out of place, Su Zui actually doesn’t have a good reason to direct his anger at him for no reason.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t for the system's notification, he could really not tell that Fu Shijun had impure thoughts towards him when he looked like this.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui can’t tell what he felt helpless about.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
He paused for a moment before exposing an obedient smile like before under Fu Shijun’s uncertain gaze: “Ok. You can decide.”
<br/><br/>
Being a 40% attack completion, it already can’t be labeled as occasionally having a  favorable impression.
<br/><br/>
He was suddenly a bit curious. Just how long does Fu Shijun need to be repressed before he gathered up his courage and showed his affection to him.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
While Su Zui was busy pondering on the boss’s mysterious affection route, the Su Family’s mood was cloudy.
<br/><br/>
Once Xie Yan returned home, she couldn’t stop herself from crying.
<br/><br/>
While Fu Shijing didn’t pay any attention to her after those few sentences, but for her, Fu Shijing’s existence was a terrifying existence in her heart.
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi was also in an annoyed mood.
<br/><br/>
His personality required people to give him face.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Being mocked in front of so many people but was unable to rebutte back, his heart felt more unbearable than when people slapped him in the face.
<br/><br/>
In the latter part of the dinner, he didn’t know how he was able to hold himself back!
<br/><br/>
Hearing Xie Yan’s crying, he became more annoyed and finally can’t resist slamming the door: “Cry cry cry! All you know is how to cry! What’s the use of crying! If you are brave enough, go cry in front of them! All you do is stay home and disgust me!”
<br/><br/>
“It’s all your fault for wanting to go. If it wasn’t for you, how could I lose face in front of so many people?! Is peacefully staying at home and be Madam Su not good enough! I didn’t marry you in just for you to make me lose face!”
<br/><br/>
Wasn’t it you who willingly brought me along?
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan could hardly believe it. Su Chengzhi actually pushed the responsibility to her.
<br/><br/>
But with how angry Su Chengzhi looked, she didn’t dare talk back.
<br/><br/>
After being continuously screamed at, her eyes became big and her cries became stuck in her throat, causing her to continuously hiccup. She looked pathetic and pitiful.
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo coldly looked at Su Chengzhi’s incomparably ugly and angry face.
<br/><br/>
A nauseous feeling flashed through her heart.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
This person didn’t have any ability and was humiliated because of it, yet was acting as if they were the emperor at home.
<br/><br/>
With this type of attitude, Su Chengzhi only had a small amount of patience to begin with.
<br/><br/>
After Su Chengzhi finished shouting, he angrily drove away to an unknown place to do unknown things, leaving Xie Yan wiping her tears alone at the sofa.
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan who felt attacked: “How can he be like this?!”
<br/><br/>
While Su Chengzhi wasn’t consider a good person, but he had always treated her well and very rarely gotten angry at her.
<br/><br/>
How can he suddenly became like this?
<br/><br/>
What she didn’t noticed was that what changed wasn’t Su Chengzhi.
<br/><br/>
This man never had a warm or compassionate personality.
<br/><br/>
It was only that before, his anger was always directed at the isolated Su Zui. After his anger was released, he naturally became opened towards other people.
<br/><br/>
Now that Su Zui had left, someone in the house will inevitably became the next person for Su Chengzhi to release his anger on.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo patted Xie Yan’s back: “Just endure it a bit more. Once the company is in my hand, we can go to the Fu Family.”
<br/><br/>
Once Xie Yan heard these words, she collapsed again: “With how Fu Shijing is acting right now, will he accept you in the future?”
<br/><br/>
Yet Su Zhimo was very calm: “It’s only because he doesn’t know of my identity. The Fu Family right now follows whatever Fu Shijun says. Fu Shijun let him come to deal with us, how can he dare say no?”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan was still a bit worried: “With such a bad relationship right now, won’t it affect your guys’ interaction in the future?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s eyes flashed with certainty: “You don’t need to worry. I don’t need to have him give me any fatherly affection. As long as there’s enough benefits on the line, it will be enough to move him.”
<br/><br/>
She used a low voice to explain to her mother: “Fu Shijun control things with an iron fist. While the other people in the Fu Family can’t say no, but how is it impossible for their hearts to not have any anger or dissatisfaction? Didn’t you see it? After Fu Shijun left today, Fu Shijing had a really ugly expression.”
<br/><br/>
“......If there was an opportunity, who could want to continue being a waste?”
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph4">
It was too bad that Fu Shijing was exactly an unmotivated salty fish<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a>.
<br/><br/>
After receiving an anonymous email saying that he had a child outside, Fu Shijing didn’t pay it any attention at first.
<br/><br/>
Being a man who had enough previous partners to circle one round around A city, he had frequently received this type of email.
<br/><br/>
Their family was a rich family that had lots of money and power. The amount of people who wanted to rely on their child to marry into the family wasn’t small.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Fu Shijun was an unmovable god, so everyone charged at him instead.
<br/><br/>
What can they do? Out of the entire Fu Family, it was only him who didn’t want to struggle to become something bigger and played around, making him easy to take advantage of.
<br/><br/>
That’s why he was always very careful. He may play but he will definitely not give anyone a chance to be pregnant.
<br/><br/>
When someone did try their best and successfully gotten pregnant, they will immediately be forced to get an abortion by him.
<br/><br/>
This type of hurrying to be recognized into the family had an eighty to ninety percent chance that they were forcefully trying to bump porcelain.
<br/><br/>
Yet when he looked down, his attitude changed.
<br/><br/>
While wanting to be recognized was mentioned a few times, this email’s main goal was to ask if they could partner up with him to plot against Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
He can’t help but admit that this email’s wording and narrative were really hypnotizing.
<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijing read it once, his heart were actually filled with excitement, as if he could successfully beat his cold and brutal little brother and become the authoritative person in the entire Fu Family in the next second.
<br/><br/>
It was only during dinner time when he heard Grandfather Fu and Fu Shijun discussing the company’s latest big project at the dining table that he discovered that he completely don’t understand a single word and suddenly snapped out of it.
 <br/><br/>
What just happened? How did he waste an entire day thinking about such absurd thing?<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu noticed his gaze: “What’s wrong with you? Always peeking at your little brother? Did you caused some trouble outside again?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijin’s heart has some guilt and he messily stuffed his mouth: “It’s nothing. It’s nothing. How could I dare cause trouble! You guys quickly eat. Quit always thinking about evicting your son.”
<br/><br/>
While he might occasionally felt anger because of Fu Shijun’s inhumane attitude, but it was only limited to this.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t have any crazy thoughts about fighting Fu Shijun and become Fu Corporation’s CEO.
<br/><br/>
With the Fu Corporation being such a big corporation, the workload was super scary. Looking at Fu Shijun’s workload, he can already feel a headache.
<br/><br/>
He never thought that he had a tenth of Fu Shijun’s capability and can bring Fu Corporation to the top.
<br/><br/>
He also don’t feel with that type of pressure, he can have any personal time after work.
<br/><br/>
Right now, he can eat, drink, and play as much as he liked. His days were especially comfortable.
<br/><br/>
Just how much of a retard does he have to be to want to fight with his little brother for family property?
<br/><br/>
Even if he can endure, even if he can obtain it, he can’t guard it! 
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Why was he almost bewitched by this nonsense reason?
<br/><br/>
Was it really because he played all day that his brain also became rotten?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing immersed himself in the tragedy that his IQ may have problems and was full of suffering as he ate his dinner.
<br/><br/>
After he finished eating, he conscientiously printed out that email and gave it to Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
He tried to use his loud voice to express his loyalty: “Brother, I feel like the person think I am stupid and want to use me! Don’t worry, I won’t be lied to with this lowly method!”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun finished reading the email in a few glances and his face was indifferent: “While you are indeed stupid, but this email may have some true.”
<br/><br/>
Without waiting for Fu Shijing’s protest, he threw down a bomb without a change of expression: “Did you know you have a daughter outside?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing was scared that his eyes became fixed on Fu Shijun: “Lit-, little brother. Don’t scare me…….”
