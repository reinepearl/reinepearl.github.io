								<strong>This chapter contains some homophobic behavior. </strong>
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang, who has yet to know he was on the verge of turning into cooked pork, was still under high pressure.
<br/><br/>
While it is stable over at Su Zui’s side, but his mom is still staring at him like a tiger watching its prey.
　　<br/><br/>
He turned his head back, and already hear his mom said: “Yuanhang. You can’t stay at this place, go back with me!”
<br/><br/>
The mother who was hitting and cursing him just now, suddenly started bawling: “It’s definitely because someone lead you astray! There’s all kinds of people in big cities! You go home and be content with marrying and having kids! Don’t think about these dishonest practices ever again!”
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang thought of something and her shrewd voice yelled: “Was it that friend that lead you astray?!”
　　 <br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang heard these words and his legs turned weak, and almost completely fell onto the ground.
<br/><br/>
He struggled ten something years before climbing out of that destitute place, he cannot return just like this!
　　<br/><br/>
After getting used to the bustling and lively city and experiencing the life of surpassing people, he knew without a doubt that if he were to be thrown back into that internetless impoverished mountain village, he might be blocked from life to the point he will go crazy.
<br/><br/>
But the accumulated pressure his mother gave was like a big mountain, hitting him full on and almost choking him.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang incessantly swallowed his saliva: “Mom…...you should calm down. I, I……”
<br/><br/>
He “I” for half a day, before calming down and said: “If we went back just like this, how will other people view you? They will definitely gossip and say that it was because I was unable to mix with the outside, so that’s why I ran back with my tail between my legs. And they will also point at you too. You suffered so much in order to raise me. Won’t this be a waste?”
　　<br/><br/>
“That friend of mine…...you can just considered it as me having a rich girlfriend. Truthfully, I had no choice. Right now, my career is on the rise and needs help. Wait until I am stable and then the two of us won’t have any relations anymore.”
<br/><br/>
“Don’t you believe in the son that you personally taught? Wait a few years. I will definitely marry a worthy wife and give you several grandsons. After a few years, we can drive back and have plenty of face, to the point that whoever sees us will be full of envy.”
　　<br/><br/>
“.......As for the things right now, I am careful. Nobody will find out. If you don’t broadcast it outside, who will know?”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing Yang Yuanhang’s words, Mother Yang’s cries slowly stopped.
<br/><br/>
She was silent for half a day before wiping away her tears and said: “Yuanhang. You can’t lie to me. I only have you as my only son. You are my life!”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang let out a breath.
<br/><br/>
While his mom was stubborn, but she still has an Achilles’ heel.
<br/><br/>
It was the want for him to be successful, want to the point she dreams about it.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang carried the slap mark on his face while patting his mother on the back: “Mom, I’m also doing this for our family.”
<br/><br/>
Mother Yang grasped his hand: “You must break up with him.”
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang: “You don’t have to worry. I will definitely do it. But you also need to control yourself a bit, and not expose anything in front of that friend. Just pretend to not know anything.”
　　<br/><br/>
He lied without blinking his eyes: “The other person also doesn’t want others to know. When he grows older, he will also marry. This is a very normal thing.”
<br/><br/>
While in reality, Su Zui had brought up on multiple occasions that as long as he was willing, they can come out of the closet together.
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang murmured: “That, that is good. You have plans in your heart.”
　　<br/><br/>
The boy who was still curled under the blanks was trembling due to disgust.
<br/><br/>
While he admits he doesn’t have any three views<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>, but the words said by the mother and son pair before his eyes still open his eyes.
　　<br/><br/>
He shivered in his heart. Taking advantage of the lack of attention, he picked up his clothes and hurriedly stick to the wall and slip away.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
On the way home, Su Zui looked at the video the system cut out, and made a sound of admiration: “No wonder they are related.”
<br/><br/>
Hearing his son will lie to marry a woman, Mother Yang was actually full of approval.
<br/><br/>
Only thinking about self-interest and simply not caring how cruel it was to lie to a girl.
　　<br/><br/>
But this makes sense. For Yang Yuanhang to grow up to be such a selfish and cold blooded person, it should have some relation to his family teaching.
　　<br/><br/>
This video was taken from the monitor Su Zhimo planted inside his home.
<br/><br/>
Except before it could be put to good use, system 555 had already hacked into it and became his tool to monitor his pig’s ecology.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui glanced at it a few times before losing interest: “Just shut it. It’s hindering my driving.”
　　<br/><br/>
………
　　<br/><br/>
The next day, Su Zui was only in for half a day before someone knocked on his door.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “Enter.”
　　<br/><br/>
The person who entered pushed his documents over: “......Manager, this is the revised proposal. Please have a look.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui opened the document to take a look. After glancing at it, he already have his conclusion: “On a whole, there isn’t any problem.”
　　<br/><br/>
The person who entered didn’t have time to let out a sigh of relief before hearing him say: “But this is too on guard. What the client wants is a high result. If this proposal is followed, while it is safe, its power is too small.”
<br/><br/>
He took a pen and circled some areas and added a few criticisms: “Redo it.”
　　<br/><br/>
The employee’s complexion became a faint green. 
<br/><br/>
This new proposal was created after they worked overtime for several nights! They really weren’t fooling around!
　　<br/><br/>
That day, Su Zui left them with a psychological shadow.
<br/><br/>
Looking so soft and peaceful, but who knew he was actually ruthless! Not only does he know everything, but when he gets angry, he can scare everybody to the point their legs become soft!
<br/><br/>
After the whole group returned to their office that day, for ten whole minutes, everyone minded their own business. No one dared to talk.
<br/><br/>
It was only until half a day later when someone spoke softly: “How about…...we start a new proposal?”
<br/><br/>
Everyone nodded their heads one after the other, as if a wolf was chasing behind them. They all took the initiative to work overtime until deep into the night and use their highest efficiency to finish in one day, before hurriedly sending it to Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
They were afraid this person would suspect them for working too slow and call them over and scold them again.
　　<br/><br/>
Yet now, the proposal they worked so hard on was disregarded just like that.
<br/><br/>
Feeling bitter but not daring to say anything, the small employee who experienced what happened yesterday didn’t dare talk back to Su Zui, and can only say: “Yes manager.”
<br/><br/>
His colleagues also did not dare to say anything. Seeing him shaking his head with an anguished face, they could only groan and moan before working on the modifications.
　　<br/><br/>
Just like this, the proposal was changed seven or eight times before they finally created a proposal that allowed Su Zui to nod his head.
<br/><br/>
The process was very painful, but seeing their created product, practically all the employees couldn’t believe their own eyes.
<br/><br/>
They have been working for several years and was an experienced worker; it was only natural that they were able to see how big this proposal’s value was!
　　<br/><br/>
Some people slapped on the project case and bragged: “This awesome proposal was actually created using my collaboration! I am indeed a genius!” 
<br/><br/>
Right away, there were people ruthlessly poking holes: “......Don’t be dramatic. The creativity was all created by the manager.”
　　<br/><br/>
While they had been tortured for the past few days and don’t know how many hair had fallen off, but now, they have been thoroughly won over by Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
While the other had appeared out of nowhere, but with this level, being an insignificant project manager and carrying them was really a waste of talent!
　　<br/><br/>
After the proposal passed through Su Zui, it was quickly send over to the client.
<br/><br/>
After the employee responsible for the exchange delivered the material, he bragged within the group: “I have a feeling, this proposal approval will the quickest since the beginning of history!
<br/><br/>
Voices of agreement followed below.
<br/><br/>
“I also feel the same way!”
<br/><br/>
“Me too!”
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, it wasn’t half a day before their faces got slapped.
<br/><br/>
The other side received the material and quickly send feedback.
<br/><br/>
Have objection. Need change.
　　<br/><br/>
Normally, this was nothing. Being the second party, modifying and correcting are a very normal process.
<br/><br/>
If there was a day where the first party pass it through without any change, then it will be raining red rain.
　　<br/><br/>
But the problem lies in, this client’s objections were too many, as if forcefully vetoing this proposal.
<br/><br/>
If they changed it according to the client, then it wasn’t any different from redoing the whole proposal.
　　<br/><br/>
The employee who facilitated this exchange bitterly send the news over to the group, making the whole group enter a deep shock.
　　<br/><br/>
“Is this real or fake? The other side really think this won’t work?
<br/><br/>
“This big of an objection? Do we have to redo it! But I think that even if I work until I drop, I won’t be able to make a proposal better than this one!”
<br/><br/>
“Releasing a blood-curdling chicken screech: GEGEGEGEGE——AH!”
<br/><br/>
“Is their company ok? To even reject this type of proposal, with this type of mentally retarded manager, sooner or later they will go bankrupt!”
　　<br/><br/>
In this miserable shrieking, there was suddenly someone who send an inharmonious “?”
<br/><br/>
Everyone angrly looked at that person’s ID and the papapa sounds from the keyboard suddenly stopped.
　　<br/><br/>
It was their manager.
<br/><br/>
After entering the group, Su Zui had never said a word. They had almost, no, they had completely forgotten about this fiend inside their chat group!
<br/><br/>
For a moment, the employees were like chickens with their necks pinched, and didn’t send out a new message for a very long time.
　　<br/><br/>
The final sentence cursing the other side for being mentally retarded was retracted at the speed of someone about to piss in their pants.
<br/><br/>
This type of angry words were too heavy. They can say it privately instead.
<br/><br/>
If it were discovered by the head, then it will be a catastrophe! 
　　<br/><br/>
Only Su Zui glanced over, and what should be seen has already been seen.
　　<br/><br/>
......Mentally defective? 
<br/><br/>
Su Zui spinned the pen in his hand.
<br/><br/>
This really have a familiar sense of smell. 
　　<br/><br/>
He didn’t need to guess and he already knows that there is an eighty percent change that this was Su Zhimo’s work.
<br/><br/>
Or else, how could a normal person harm others yet harm themself more, this type of stupid thing?
　　<br/><br/>
Them changing the proposal was just a bit more annoyance, but the ultimate effect this proposal has on was on the other side.
<br/><br/>
If the final proposal have good results, as the leader of the other party, their reward will also not be small.
　　<br/><br/>
To disregard the company’s interest, he could understand. But to disregard their own performance for the sake of hindering him, it was as if they had a deep hatred for him.
<br/><br/>
But according to his knowledge, the original should not have this type of hatred.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui allowed the system to investigate. Sure enough, it was able to quickly investigate Su Zhimo and that person’s contact log.
<br/><br/>
He put his cellphone onto the table, and suddenly remembered: “That company is under Fu Corporation?”
<br/><br/>
System 555: “Yes host.”
　　<br/><br/>
This wasn’t anything important.
<br/><br/>
Fu Corporation was also a conglomerate like the Qin Corporation. Under their name, there were at least hundreds of big and small companies.
<br/><br/>
To bump into each other during one of the collaborations was simply a regular occurrence.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui squinted his eyes: “To be able to extend her hand into the Fu Family, Su Zhimo is also very capable.”
<br/><br/>
Without even obtaining the Qin Family, she was already able to plan several nails into the Fu Family’s company.
<br/><br/>
From the start, Su Zhimo’s ambitions was big enough for people to feel apprehensive.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face appeared before Su Zui’s eyes.
<br/><br/>
While this young head of the Fu Family has always been very kind to him, but due to his innate warning, from the beginning to the end, he was still unable to relax in front of the other.
　　<br/><br/>
Actually, even now, he still wasn’t able to imagine how this one<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a>, a person who can make him feel danger all over his body, can lose to Su Zhimo in the end and lose the Fu Family.
　　<br/><br/>
Speak of the devil and he shall appear.
<br/><br/>
Just when he hesitated on whether he should give Fu Shijun a warning or not, the cellphone by his side suddenly lit up.
<br/><br/>
A notification popped out. 
　　<br/><br/>
The annoying spirit next door: [Is work still going smoothly?]
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s heart jumped from the scare: “......”
<br/><br/>
This came at a too punctual time.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t because he knew it was impossible, he could have suspect that Fu Shijun installed a monitor inside his brain.
　　<br/><br/>
After recovering, he pinched his cellphone and thought in ridicule manner.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun contacting him at this point of time, should he reply with not smoothly, not smoothly, or not smoothly?
　　<br/><br/>
Rubbing his eyebrows, Su Zui, in a rare occasion, felt slightly awkward.
<br/><br/>
He doesn’t want to be involved with the boss too deeply, but this opportunity where the boss takes his own initiative, to waste it makes his heart hurt.
　　<br/><br/>
Unable to form a decision momentarily, he simply placed the cellphone to one side and continued working on company matters.
<br/><br/>
He was on shift, it was very normal for him to not look at his cellphone.
<br/><br/>
Surely, workaholic President Fu would understand.
　　<br/><br/>
Half an hour later.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun who couldn’t resist checking on his cellphone countless times yet not receiving any replies: “......”
