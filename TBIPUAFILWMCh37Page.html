<strong>Note: If you haven't read the latter part of Ch 36, please go read the second world introduction before reading Ch 37. This note will be removed once the next chapter is posted.</strong>
<br/><br/>
Su Zui saw the complicated expression in Father Su’s eyes but let out any reaction.
<br/><br/>
He was originally not good at empathizing with people. It was good that the original’s pe<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->rsonality was gloomy. It wouldn’t be usual for him to remain silent.
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su’s impression towards the original was very complicated. Although the original was a love product between him and his wife, but at the same time, he was also the main culprit foretold by the “expert” for killing his wife.
<br/><br/>
To have no blame was impossible. But to say that he didn’t love him would also implicate the affection stemmed from their blood relations.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, before his wife died, she had rigidly gripped his hand and told him to take care of this child…...
<br/><br/>
The original’s mother wasn’t a person from the supernatural world. She was only an ordinary to the point you can’t be anymore ordinary mother. It was only that when she was pregnant with the original, she was influenced by the special bone in the original’s body and gained a bit of cultivation. It was only with this and her single-mindedness that she was able to protect the infant in her belly and allowed him to smoothly arrived into the world.
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su saw his son continued to be distracted and can only repeat once more: “Master Meng is an expert and is very good at dealing with ghost and spirit matters. Xiao Zui, you don’t need to be afraid.”
<br/><br/>
The original book’s male protagonist was called Meng Qingzhi. His uncle, Meng Heyang was the Master Meng Father Su was talking about.
　　<br/><br/>
Remembering that woman who died tragically on the surgery table, Su Zui’s eyes darkened.
<br/><br/>
He shook his head: “I’m not going.”
　　<br/><br/>
Although the extraction of the spiritual bone will allow the owner to have a moment of pe<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->ace, but that spiritual bone was placed at the original’s life line, and a slight change will affect everything else. If the person was a bit inattentive during the extraction process, then they will harm that life line. The reason why the original suddenly died three years after his extraction was because Meng Heyang’s method was too crude.
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su was only easily gullible because he was at a loss. Now that he knew the results, it would be stupid to allow Meng Heyang to do anything.
　　<br/><br/>
Actually, even if Father Su was able to find a more skilled and real master that can extract the spiritual bone without causing any damage, Su Zui still wouldn’t consent.
<br/><br/>
After the extraction of the spiritual bone, he would become a regular person. In this world where ghosts and demons were everywhere, just how weak was the strength of a regular human?
　　<br/><br/>
If it’s in a good direction, then he will only be a bit stronger than the original and live an ordinary life.
　　<br/><br/>
After seeing the original’s entire life, Su Zui became more firm in his decision to not allow anyone to steal away his spiritual bone.
<br/><br/>
Seeing his son’s sudden backing, Father Su became anxious: “I painstakingly begged the master for half a month before he agreed to extract your bone for free. Don’t be such a child. How can you say not go and don’t go? Really not sensible!”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui calmly rebutted: “How can there be a pie falling from the sky? The master has saw all kinds of harsh matters. If he was able to help every single time…...would you believe it?”
　　<br/><br/>
He looked directly at Father Su and peacefully said: “I don’t want to bet with my life.”
　　<br/><br/>
With these few sentences, the originally anxious Father Su unexpectedly became a bit star<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->tled.
<br/><br/>
His son’s peaceful voice had a sense of firmness, causing him to can’t help but follow his train of thought, and he quickly felt a bit strange.
　　<br/><br/>
That’s right. Everyday there were people who suffered in this world. Why would such an expert unexpectedly be moved by them?
　　<br/><br/>
He originally had a muddled personality or else he wouldn’t be so easily lied to. After following this train of thought, he suddenly didn’t have much trust in that expert and his attitude became hesitant: “But this opportunity is rare. That piece of jade you have already cracked a bit and almost can’t hold on anymore.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui touched the jade on his chest that was separated by his clothing: “There is still a one year period. So many years have passed already. The things ancestors left behind will definitely be more trustworthy than outsiders.”
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su took a deep breath and his eyebrows were wrinkled and tense: “It’s all my fault. It’s all my fault that I don’t have any talent and wasn’t able to learn from the stuff our ancestors left behind, and also not be able to earn enough money to find a more talented celestial master for you......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui shook his head and comforted him in a light voice: “The inheritance had long been cut during great-grandfather’s era. It wasn’t your fault.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yet Father Su continued to be vexed. One moment, he would say to not go. In another moment, he would think aloud about how they couldn’t miss this opportunity.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
But Su Zui wasn’t worried and allowed him to continue to be confused. He lowered his head and pressed his cellphone a few times.
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su was an easily swayed person. He clearly showed that he didn’t have a firm attitude. Father Su would always compromise.
　　<br/><br/>
However, in their moment of deadlock, someone suddenly knocked on the car window.
<br/><br/>
It was a young Daoist priest who had his nose to the sky. Once they rolled down the window, he impatiently said: “What are you guys waiting here for? To arrive yet not entering, don’t you know my master is very busy? How would he have the time to wait for you guys?”
　　<br/><br/>
Father Su had a natural reverence towards people in the supernatural world and immediately apologized: “Sorry, sorry. We will immediately——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui forcefully cut off Father Su’s sentence and indifferently said to the young Daoist priest: “Master Meng has busy matters. We really don’t dare to waste master’s time with our family matters. We will first bid farewell.”
　　<br/><br/>
The young Daoist priest’s arrogant expression still hasn’t subside before it was mixed with a look of startlement. For one moment, the look was very comedical: “Wait. You guys can’t leave like this!”
<br/><br/>
Master had emphasized over and over again that he definitely needed to bring these people<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> over.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t care about him and opened the screen divider to tell the driver to start the car and leave.
　　<br/><br/>
“Wait a moment!”
<br/><br/>
It was unknown when Meng Heyang came out. Compared to the flustered disciple, the expression on his face was much calmer, and even politely asked: “Mr. Su, what happened? I only agreed to help your son because of your sincere begging. I had postponed a few invitations in order to open up a time slot. Why are you willing to break this arrangement? Although I am gentle when treating people, it doesn’t mean I am willing to have people act as they wish.”
　　<br/><br/>
No matter whether or not they have actual skill, if one were just to look at the outward appearance, Meng Heyang’s image was conforming until it can’t conform anymore to the ordinary people’s image of a celestial master. A celestial aura and a majestic presence. It was simply the template of an upright gentleman. Just by looking, it would give birth to trust in a person’s heart.
　　<br/><br/>
With the pot<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> of disrespect thrown at him, Father Su immediately became anxious: “Ma-Master, we, we don’t mean it like that......”
　　<br/><br/>
Yet Su Zui didn’t even blink an eye and easily throw the pot back: “Master really thinks too much. In this type of world, master is merciful in helping the world. To want to help a person free of charge, you definitely wouldn’t have any other motive. After thoroughly thinking this over, we naturally felt that we can’t have such thick faces and take advantage of master. Master should quickly go deal with your own matters. We are really sorry for the trouble.”
<br/><br/>
Who doesn’t know how to say pretty words?
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Not only does he know how to talk, he can even speak enough to stuff and kill Meng Heyang.
　　<br/><br/>
Meng Heyang choked by his words for more than ten seconds and wasn’t able to talk, and his serene face also became a bit distrubed: “Small friend, you are still young. If you continued to be headstrong, then in the future, I’m afraid you will walk a few more wrong roads than other people.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui lazily said: “Oh, you don’t need to be worried. I’m still young. I will just consider these wrong paths as life experience.”
<br/><br/>
Meng Heyang: “......”
　　<br/><br/>
He straightforwardly stopped talking to Su Zui and turned towards Father Su, and said in a deep voice: “Mr. Su, an appointment isn’t a trifling matter. It wasn’t easy for me to make free time today. I ask of you to stop acting willfully and quickly bring this small friend to the altar!”
　　<br/><br/>
In his heart, Father Su was actually still hesitating on whether or not they should go, but Su Zui had already resolutely said those words. He can’t just slap his son’s face and can only thicken his skin and rejected: “Master, we won’t be going......”
　　<br/><br/>
Meng Heyang faintly smiled: “Mr. Su, I will say it one more time. I ask of you to stop acting willfully or else you will miss the most opportune time. The next time the altar will be opened will be three months later. In these three months, it won’t be certain whether or not your son will be safe.”
　　<br/><br/>
Even if Father Su was muddled, he would still discover that something wasn’t right at thi<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->s time. Why does this Master Meng had a faint attitude of not giving up if he wasn’t able to extract his son’s bone today?
<br/><br/>
His lips trembled and became bewildered and afraid: “Master Meng, we, we really aren’t......”
　　<br/><br/>
Under Meng Heyang’s threatening gaze, Su Zui wasn’t a bit panicky and even comforted Father Su by patting his shoulder.
　　<br/><br/>
He said in an unhurried manner: “Does the master want to force two ordinary people in front of the public? You don’t need to worry. I had already greeted other people. In half an hour, if I didn’t send the person a specific message, that person will immediately call the police.”
　　<br/><br/>
Once he said this, a split broke out in Meng Heyang’s warm and fake expression and his face started to turn green.
　　<br/><br/>
The supernatural world had its own specialized law enforcement to keep order. If the people of the supernatural world was to act recklessly and cause trouble, then they will be watched by the law enforcement. If needed, there will even be a trial and punishment. It was the equivalent to law, police, and jail of the human society. 
　　<br/><br/>
If the law enforcements were to pay attention to this matter, Meng Heyang really will be <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->out of luck.
　　<br/><br/>
The noiser this matter became, the safer Su Zui will be.
<br/><br/>
The person who should be worried should be Meng Heyang.
　　<br/><br/>
Meng Heyang was watched by the law enforcement due to his criminal record so compared to bystanders, he was more unwilling to act blindly without thinking.
<br/><br/>
Truthfully speaking, Meng Heyang, this person, was also a person with an unfavorable fate. The first time, he wanted to turn the original into a ghost baby that can follow all this orders. Except, not only did the plan unfortunately failed, but he had also attracted the attention of the law enforcement and had no choice but to know his place for a few years.
<br/><br/>
When he finally found the opportunity to steal away the original’s spiritual bone, the age was already inappropriate for the matter. Even if he used the spiritual bone, it wouldn’t be able to change his aptitude. The most it would do was raise his power by a bit. It would have been a complete waste.
<br/><br/>
As a result, he grinded his teeth and invested this enormous benefit onto his own nephew's body.
<br/><br/>
Meng Qingzhi’s father and mother were both busy people. Their relationship wasn’t very strong and his uncle would be considered as one of the closer people. The relationship between the uncle and nephew was very good. He was using Meng Qingzhi’s rise to success as a way to extract more favors and after Meng Qingzhi achieved success, he can also follow and get benefits.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Seeing Meng Heyang’s flustered yet having no way out expression, Su Zui lightly smiled and politely bid farewell to Meng Heyang: “We will leave first master. See you later.”
　　<br/><br/>
So the powerful ones gets respect?
<br/><br/>
Meng Qingzhi was able to step on his bone and blood in order to walk to the peak of the supernatural world so why can’t he climbed up to a much higher place?
 <br/><br/>
