								When Su Zui got out of bed, he offhandedly rummaged through Fu Shijun’s friend circle.
<br/><br/>
There was practically no content regarding daily live. All the content was about work. The amount was small. It only took sliding the phone two times before reaching the end. 
　　<br/><br/>
Looking all neat and proper, who knew when he got so willful he could be so annoying?
<br/><br/>
Just remembering all the twists and turns made last night till the end, yet still got forced to see the doctor, Su Zui immediately felt a burst of pain in the brain.
<br/><br/>
It’s only after looking at the experience point balance that he able to not generate any prejudice against the boss.
　　<br/><br/>
He especially woke up half an hour earlier today.
<br/><br/>
After going down, the auntie <a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> is still busy working in the kitchen.
　　<br/><br/>
The inside of the pot made gudugudu noises as the porridge boils. Tender green vegetable leaves and orange carrot cubes roll inside the densely boiled rice; its colors completely cause people’s appetite to emerge.
<br/><br/>
Auntie: “How come the Young Master woke up so early today? Today we are having porridge. Your stomach isn’t feeling comfortable. Sir told us to make something lighter.”
<br/><br/>
The auntie saw he was circling around the pot, and exposed a smile: “Impatient? It’s done in just a few minutes. The kitchen is too oily, you <a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a> should wait outside.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui shaked his head: “It’s nothing. I’m only bored. You don’t need to worry about me.”
<br/><br/>
After the porridge is done cooking, he distributed it into two bowls.
<br/><br/>
Taking advantage when the auntie wasn’t paying attention, he added a tube of transparent reagent into Grandfather Qin’s bowl.
<br/><br/>
That tube of reagent has no color or taste. After entering the bowl, it mixed together with the bowl and no indication of it can be found.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui said: “I’ll help you bring it out.”
<br/><br/>
Then he steadily carried the bowl containing the extra ingredient to Grandfather Qin.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin: ???
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin was very surprised: “Xiao Zui, you went to make breakfast?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “I didn’t. I’m only carrying the bowl out. Of course, if you feel like I made this, I don’t mind.”
<br/><br/>
He pushed the porridge towards Grandfather Qin, and urged without batting an eyelash: “You should drink it now. The weather is cold nowadays. If it gets cold, it won’t taste good.”
　　<br/><br/>
Don’t judge this porridge by how average it looks, in fact there is an added upgrade body’s constitution reagent costing up to six hundred experience points, almost half his property!
<br/><br/>
But the effect was definitely worth the money.  
　　<br/><br/>
[Constitution Strengthening Reagent-Initial Version]
<br/><br/>
[Rank: B]
<br/><br/>
[Property: Single-time usage]
<br/><br/>
[Effect: After use, the person’s constitution will rise up one level within half a month. The effect will last forever inside a single world.]
<br/><br/>
[Usage Restriction: Can only be used on living organisms.]
<br/><br/>
[Summary: Want to slap face or counterattack? Want to be a winner in life? Want to become SSSS rank constitution boss? Constitution strengthening reagent series is the underlying essential! Aside from the initial version, there are also advanced version and ultimate version to pick from~]
　　<br/><br/>
While the initial version of the upgrading body constitution reagent can only upgrade one’s body up a level and hearing it feels lacking, but towards Grandfather Qin, this approaching sunset type of elder, drinking it can cause the body to be younger by thirty to forty years with no problem.
<br/><br/>
Just in case there really is an accident, it won’t be like how it is in the original novel where he directly died from anger in the intensive care room.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at Grandfather Qin drinking the expensive bowl of porridge until it was finished without blinking, and only then did his heart returned to his stomach <a href = "#footnote3bottom" id = "footnote3top">(3)</a>.
<br/><br/>
He finished his own bowl in two to three bites and said: “Grandfather, I want to go to the company to gain experience.”
<br/><br/>
After working so hard for the past few days, he already understand nearly all the theories. Su Zui felt that it should be time to gain experience through practice.
　　<br/><br/>
To speak the truth, if it was still the original right now, even if he studied with his life, there wouldn’t be such a big improvement in such a short amount of time.
<br/><br/>
It’s only that Su Zui’s spirit was stronger than that of the people in this world, was he able to learn in such a fast speed.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin thought for a while and said: “Then I will first arrange you into a branched office.”
　　<br/><br/>
This type of successor from aristocratic family were usually groomed from when they were young.
<br/><br/>
From childhood, the child is influenced by instilling the concept of company management into their words and actions and then have them choose a relevant major in college.
<br/><br/>
In such a long time, as long as the child wasn’t too stupid, they could still be enlightened.
　　<br/><br/>
But Su Zui wasn’t the same.
<br/><br/>
Ever since his mother passed away, this child never became close with anyone.
<br/><br/>
He suggested a few times about bringing Su Zui back to the Qin family to raise, but ultimately failed.
<br/><br/>
During college, he and Su Zui tried to persuade him to select business studies, but Su Zui was in his rebellious phase that time and didn’t listen to him.
　　<br/><br/>
Wasting so much time, the Su Zui of now and other family’s successors definitely have a sizable gap between them.
<br/><br/>
He actually felt that Su Zui was anxious for quick results. Looking at information for a few days and think he already mastered it, it was honestly not stable.
<br/><br/>
But looking at his enthusiastic grandson, he couldn’t bare to reject him.
<br/><br/>
Probably after experiencing some hard times, he will understand how to be more steady.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui understood that Grandfather Qin was worried, but even if he explained right now, it won’t relieve the worries from Grandfather Qin’s heart.
<br/><br/>
It’s more effective to talk with accomplishments.
<br/><br/>
He smiled and blinked his eyes: “Once I experience a difficult situation, I’ll need to thicken my face and ask you for help.”
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Su Zui was quickly arranged to enter Qin Corporation's subsidiary company. 
<br/><br/>
Because he lacked experience, in order to let him fully understand the company business, he was arranged into a project manager position and was given a not big but not small project for him to practice. 
<br/><br/>
After accumulating accomplishments was he able to keep ascending.
　　<br/><br/>
This company was media oriented. The main job was to promote and help clients attract customers.
<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui wasn’t familiar with this, but his brain was very flexible and was able to learn quickly.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, he had the system’s assistance.
　　<br/><br/>
System 555’s data analysis ability was simply very formidable.
<br/><br/>
It gathered all the successful marketing activity data within the past five years of this world, and after processing it for a few minutes, it summarized it into what can be said to be a marketing template textbook.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui analyzed this book, and using only half a day, he was able to issue out a rough plan targeting the project’s goal.
<br/><br/>
As long as it followed this plan, there was an eighty percent chance of certainty, this case will become a famous marketing case in the industry in the future.
　　<br/><br/>
However, he didn’t urgently announce this plan. Instead he turned on his computer and looked over the plan his subordinates send over.
<br/><br/>
After flipping over a few pages, Su Zui already raised his eyebrows.
　　<br/><br/>
This proposal looked very pretty, but in reality, it was covered with pitfalls.
<br/><br/>
If he was really a novice who doesn’t understand anything, then maybe his eyes will shine and impatiently pass this plan.
　　<br/><br/>
But Su Zui wasn’t that stupid.
<br/><br/>
If he really acted according to this plan, then before he even accumulate accomplishments, he will probably lose respect first.
<br/><br/>
He will have to go back and face Grandfather Qin and embarrassingly report back.
　　<br/><br/>
He closed the project case and called for the responsible employees to come in.
<br/><br/>
Without nonsense, he directly pointed at a few points: “Here, here, and here. All out of the question.”
<br/><br/>
“Go bring it back and change it.”
　　<br/><br/>
The employees looked at each other, their eyes exposed their astonishment.
<br/><br/>
This project case indeed was created by them to deceive this appearing out of nowhere project manager.
<br/><br/>
But they the way they created it was super brilliant. If it wasn’t those elders who worked in the industry for years, then there was practically no one that can spot the pitfalls.
　　<br/><br/>
How can Su Zui spot it? That’s not possible!
<br/><br/>
Wasn’t he just a person who came through the back door and doesn’t understand anything?
<br/><br/>
This type of people they saw a lot. Using their relations with the company’s president, they sit in the administer position just by coming in.
　　<br/><br/>
Being suppressed by this type of people, their hearts inevitably felt agitated.
<br/><br/>
Of course, these people who have stayed in the industry for a few years, will definietly be stupid enough to directly challenged this person.
<br/><br/>
But to use a few underhanded methods to make him eat some loss was also pretty easy to do.
　　<br/><br/>
The manager was responsible for investigating everything thoroughly. When bad things really happen, the blame won’t fall on the small employees.
<br/><br/>
The one to suffer damage was the Qin Corporation. The one getting scolded was Su Zui. It has nothing to do with them.
　　<br/><br/>
Since Su Zui dared to come in and sit in the project manager position, then he should assume the responsibility of failure!
　　<br/><br/>
Their plan was very good, they want to give this appearing out of nowhere manager a lesson.
<br/><br/>
Let him know, appearing out of nowhere wasn’t something you can have just by desiring it.
<br/><br/>
But they didn’t think that at very first step, they already kicked on hard nails.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui unexpectantly pointed out all the pitfalls they set up, all of them pointed out accurately.
　　<br/><br/>
The atmosphere suddenly became quiet.
<br/><br/>
After ten seconds, someone finally opened their mouth.
<br/><br/>
“Manager, it’s like this. We did this in the past and the results were very good. This is the most stable route!”
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing someone taking the lead, all the others began to talk at once.
<br/><br/>
“Manager, bring forth new ideas is a good thing, but this is too extreme. When the time comes and the results aren’t good, then we also can’t report back with a good conscience.” 
<br/><br/>
“Right right. If it was changed just like you said, then the hazards will become bigger.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was too lazy to talk nonsense with them, and directly threw the project case onto the table: “Shut up.”
<br/><br/>
All the people were scared to the point they jumped, and without prior agreement, they all shut up.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui word by word said: “Don’t stay here and pretend to be blind. Go bring it back right now and change it. Change it until I’m satisfied with it.”
<br/><br/>
His voice wasn’t loud, the tone clear, so much so that his expression wasn’t even strict.
<br/><br/>
But when his tranquil gaze swept over, all the people felt as if something dangerous was staring at them.
<br/><br/>
So long as they dare to move a bit, they will be savagely bitten by that thing. 
　　<br/><br/>
Under the invisible pressure, the employees were as quiet as chicken, not daring to utter a single complaint.
<br/><br/>
When they finally brought the project case out of the manager’s office, their expressions were still lifeless.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Su Zui stayed behind to plan out the project’s details and was the last one to leave the company.
<br/><br/>
Because he was coming to work, he drove the original’s cheapest Toyota today. The black car body was extremely low-key.
<br/><br/>
He just exited the parking lot, when suddenly a person appeared right in front of his car and blocked him.
　　<br/><br/>
He focused his attention and found the hitchhiker wasn’t just anybody, it was Yang Yuanhang who he hasn't seen for a few days.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
To actually discover where he worked in such a short period of time, the female lead’s intelligence network sure was fast. 
　　<br/><br/>
His speed didn’t slow down as he kept driving forward for a while, before slowly stepping on the brake.
<br/><br/>
The car stopped near Yang Yuanhang’s body. The distance was less than ten centimeters.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s face was deathly white and his body swayed a couple times, and had to support himself with the car’s front hood to prevent himself from falling down.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t think Su Zui simply didn’t notice him, and almost encountered a car accident just like that.
<br/><br/>
His originally white face became a bit better and his legs finally stop being soft before he went over to knock on Su Zui’s window.
<br/><br/>
His face carried anger.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui rolled down the window, and didn’t wait for him to say anything before spitting out two words: “Get in.”
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was dumbfounded.
<br/><br/>
Before he came, he already had a pot of anger. Just now, he was almost hit. He had wanted to get in and take it out on Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui looked at him without any expression, yet it gave him an indescribable feeling…...to retreat.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was a bit impatient: “Hurry up.”
<br/><br/>
Because this event was unprecedented, there were already a lot of people watching from the side.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t want to play tug of war at the company’s entrance and give people extra gossip material for no reason.
<br/><br/>
That will lose too much face.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was silent for a moment, but still listened to Su Zui and detoured around to open the shotgun door.
<br/><br/>
As a result, he…...can’t pull it open.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui reminded him: “The back.”
<br/><br/>
Still want to sit shotgun? Dream on.
<br/><br/>
Seeing Yang Yuanhang’s face, he was worried he will throw up once he drives.
　　<br/><br/>
Before, Su Zui had always let him sit in the front.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang opened and closed his mouth, but didn’t say anything in the end, pulled open the door at the back, and sat down.
　　<br/><br/>
Once Yang Yuanhang got on, he immediately attempted to settle the score: “Xiao Zui, you almost hit me just now——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s tone was more polite than his: “Brother Yang, what you did just now was too dangerous. How can you just suddenly stop in front of a car? I was able to brake in time so nothing happened, but some drivers have no eyes. If it was someone else, who knows if you could already be laying on the ground dead.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang: “......”
<br/><br/>
Why did he feel like Su Zui’s words are cursing him to die?
<br/><br/>
That car speed, if it really hit him, the most it could do was injure him.
　　<br/><br/>
He still wanted to argue with Su Zui, but remembering how he almost hit the front of the car just now, he was unable to speak.
<br/><br/>
A moment ago when the car sped towards him, he had truly experience the fear of dying.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang spoke dryly: “I will be careful.”
<br/><br/>
He asked again: “That man at the restaurant that day——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui interrupted him once again: “Brother Yang, I’m driving right now. If you have something to say, we can talk after we get back. In case an accident happens, it will be too late for regrets.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was silent for a moment before saying: “Then you drive first.”
　　<br/><br/>
The two were silent the whole way until the car entered the district, Yang Yuanhang finally wouldn’t resist and opened his mouth: “Xiao Zui, who was that man at the restaurant that day?”
<br/><br/>
He said: “I didn’t reach out to you for two days was because I want you to reach out to me on your own. But…...you let me down too much. If I didn’t come today, were you planning on avoiding me and not talk?”
<br/><br/>
Having to restrain his anger the whole time, it finally exploded: “You are young. I can let you do other things but this type of things I can’t. You have to give me an explanation!”
　　<br/><br/>
After returning home that day, he was prepared to give Su Zui the cold-shoulder like he used to and wait for him to admit his mistakes.
<br/><br/>
Day after day, he suddenly remembered, the Su Zui of now doesn’t take any initiatives towards him. 
<br/><br/>
If he kept on waiting, there was an eighty percent change that there won’t be any results.
<br/><br/>
Once Su Zhimo knew Su Zui’s location, he personally came to condemn him.
　　<br/><br/>
No matter what, Su Zui was wronged in this matter.
<br/><br/>
Hugging another man right in front of him, and pretending he was empty air. Just declaring it will cause other people to ridicule the green hat on top of his head!
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui quietly waited until he finished talking before saying: “Brother Yang, you shouldn’t think too much.”
<br/><br/>
He absolutely wasn’t worried at all by Yang Yuanhang’s anger. Instead, he touched his cellphone, his manner relaxed to the point of it being half-heartedly: “He was only a friend from work. I wasn’t feeling well that day, so I didn’t have the energy to talk to you.”
　　<br/><br/>
This cover was so lazily created to the point of not trying.
<br/><br/>
As if Yang Yuanhang’s indigiant and anger were an insignificant act in front of his eyes.
<br/><br/>
Not only was it not worth is worry, it was also not worth his energy.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was angered by his indifferent attitude to the point of being unable to breath. His whole person was angered to the point of losing his rationality: “Friend? A friend that hugs for no reason? You dare to act like this in front of me, when I’m not there, do you guys take off your clothes and hug in bed?”
　　<br/><br/>
“Yang Yuanhang.” Su Zui’s voice became cold. He directly stared at Yang Yuanhang and said: “You used to stay with your underclassmen in the art room the whole day and hug each other to the point it hurts the eyes. Have I ever said anything?”
　　<br/><br/>
To make Yang Yuanhang happy, the original gave him a custom-made spacious art room for him to work in.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang loved to show off and frequently brought underclassmen home and instructed them in the art room.
<br/><br/>
His level wasn’t high enough to teach others, so he could only pretend to students who just entered college.
　　<br/><br/>
Several times, the original would meet this type of Yang Yuanhang by accident and became unhappy.
<br/><br/>
While he knew Yang Yuanhang was unlikely to cause trouble in front of his face, but seeing his lover laughing with other young men, his heart inevitably became sour.
<br/><br/>
He mentioned it to Yang Yuanhang and Yang Yuanhang laughed at him and said he was thinking too much, that the world doesn’t have that many gay people.
　　<br/><br/>
In the end, it was after the original exploded that Yang Yuanhang stopped bringing people back.
<br/><br/>
Even if he brought people back, it was at a time when the original wasn’t a home.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was silent for a moment: “I was working at that time. When we paint, we circle around the canvas which is a small area. It’s hard for us to come in contact. Why are you always so petty?”
<br/><br/>
While he does occasionally touched his underclassmen when he was instructing, but it was very limited.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t do anything to those underclassmen.
<br/><br/>
He planned on marrying and having kids in the future, he can’t let too many people know he likes guys.
　　<br/><br/>
Bringing this up, it’s Su Zui’s fault for being too shy.
<br/><br/>
He normally sticks to him, but every single time he wants to be more intimate, he will find a reason and put it off.
<br/><br/>
One or two times can be appealing, but as the number increases, his interest gradually became weak.
　　<br/><br/>
He has a physiology of a normal guy. Holding back the whole day was difficult.
<br/><br/>
He hasn't gone out to find people in three months and can only make use of every second to eat to one’s content. He was already done being worthy of Su Zui.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at him and smiled: “Oh. Then according to this logic, you approaching other people at work is considered normal, me approaching other people at social interactions is considered cheating, correct?
<br/><br/>
The way he said this was extremely direct and extremely hard for people to accept. Yang Yuanhang was unable to reply, and can only say: “You know this isn’t what I mean.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui sighed, a pair of warm eyes looked at him: “Brother Yang, my friend’s family is too strong. It’s not possible to walk the homosexual route. You can say these sour words to me, but if you really make a ruckus in other people’s eyes and influenced their reputation, I may not be necessarily be able to protect you.”
　　<br/><br/>
These few sentences carried a hint of threat. 
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui’s expression toward him was still warm, as if it returned back to the past.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was unable to differentiate it for a moment. In a daze, he said: “You…...weren’t like this before.”
　　<br/><br/>
He gave Yang Yuanhang a smile: “Brother Yang, you have to believe me. I want to be with you for a long time, so we need to understand each other more.”
　　<br/><br/>
He had been very busy for the past few days, and originally didn’t plan on caring about Yang Yuanhang.
<br/><br/>
But since Yang Yuanhang was in such a hurry to disgust people, then he can only return the favor and send the prepared present to Yang Yuanhang in advance.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
