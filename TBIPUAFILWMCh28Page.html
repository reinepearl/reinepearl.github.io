In the end, Fu Shijun still followed Su Zui into the bathroom.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s suggestion was very logical to the point that he couldn’t point out any problem. It was only because his thoughts were not pure that he could feel awkward. In reality, he wasn’t in any position to reject.
　　<br/><br/>
Moreover, he wouldn’t bare to do it.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t because of his injuries this time, even if he were to wait until the end of time, he probably wouldn’t receive this much of Su Zui’s care for him.
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, he didn’t need to wait too long.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
He was very certain that once his injuries healed, Su Zui will quickly increase the distance between the two of them and return to his original familiar but polite attitude.
<br/><br/>
Once he thought of this, Fu Shijun’s eyes faintly flashed with gloominess.
<br/><br/>
When Su Zui helped him unbutton his shirt, his hanged down fingers twitched a couple of times but didn’t lift it up in the end.
<br/><br/>
He only closed his eyes and endured.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui unbuttoned all the buttons, he can’t help but raise his eyebrows.
<br/><br/>
Although he really didn’t think too much when he was unbuttoning, but when he really saw all the elegant and powerful muscles, it wasn’t as if all his heart was completely stagnant.
<br/><br/>
Most of all, not only was President Fu’s muscle good to look at, his waistline was also very beautiful. Not only was it narrow and tight, it also looked powerful. At the edge of his suit pants where a leather belt was fastened, Su Zui was able to faintly see his mermaid line.
　　<br/><br/>
Humans are naturally competitive. Seeing what can be rated as a completely mature male body, Su Zui can’t help but think of his own.
<br/><br/>
After he used Constitution Strengthening Reagent, although his constitution had raised by a huge amount, but his stature didn’t have any major changes and was still soft from head to toe.
<br/><br/>
Even after he diligently trained after he transmigrated over, he was barely able to separate himself from the white cut chicken category. His muscles were all light and could only been seen if he tightens it up.
　　<br/><br/>
If one were to look at those muscles alone, it was still passable. But if it were to be compared to that of Fu Shijun’s, then it was simply like a baby tooth child drawing laughter from people due to their childishness.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui can’t help but feel a bit strange.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t because it was a trouble for Fu Shijun to change clothes with his single hand, then he cou<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->ldn’t need to receive this provocation.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun saw that Su Zui’s gaze was pacing back and forth on his body all along and saw that he had an ill look in his eyes, and his originally unstable mentality slowly crumbled. 
<br/><br/>
After hesitating a few times, he can’t help but tighten up his face and carefully explained himself: “......It’s because I was staying in the hospital all along that my figure declined.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “............”
<br/><br/>
Probably because he became so dizzy from anger from Fu Shijun’s “flaunting” that Su Zui suddenly had an evil thought. He raised his hand and slapped that beautiful piece of muscle.
<br/><br/>
The “PA” noise was clear and sharp, and echoed in the quiet bathroom.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun jumped from the scare. The place that was hit trembled a couple of times and the muscles became more taut.
<br/><br/>
Without even understanding why he was suddenly hit, he heard Su Zui calmly said: “Raise your arm. I’m about to take off your clothes.”
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Fu Shijun’s breathing became heavy and forgot to look into the matter of him getting hit. It was only after a few seconds that he stopped being stiff and raised his uninjured arm from Su Zui’s urging.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was extremely careful in helping Fu Shijun take off his clothes. To prevent harming the injured arm, the whole process took a full five minutes.
<br/><br/>
After successfully taking off Fu Shijun’s clothes, he lightly breathed out and even his forehead was full of sweat.
　　<br/><br/>
After the clothes that were covering the upper body was completely removed, Fu Shijun’s waist was also revealed. The outline was especially sturdy and beautiful.
<br/><br/>
This time, Su Zui learned from before and controlled his eyes and not allowed them to wander.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t dare to delay and threw the clothes in the laundry basket in the corner. He took a towel soaked with warm water and wiped Fu Shijun’s chest.
　　<br/><br/>
The faint brown tea stains were wiped away by the towel. Because of the remainants of the hot water, white steam rose from the cleaned skin.
<br/><br/>
Separated by the towel, Su Zui can also feel the level of tautness beneath his hand.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
It wasn’t wrong to say it was facing an enemy, like he was something extremely dangerous and holding a knife instead of a towel.
　　<br/><br/>
But he understands Fu Shijun’s response and didn’t say anything. Instead, he focused on wiping and only wanted this to end as quickly as possible.
<br/><br/>
What he didn’t notice was how the body’s owner’s hand, which was leaning on the item rack, was gradually tightening up. The veins in the back of the hand and arm was also bursting out. It was apparent to the point that one could see the movement of the blood flow. 
　　<br/><br/>
“Whew——”
<br/><br/>
It was only after Su Zui finished wiping that he realized they forgot to bring a new set of clothes in and that they needed to go to the closet outside to grab it.
<br/><br/>
The problem was that he still didn’t know which clothes Fu Shijun ought to wear.
　　<br/><br/>
After deliberating for awhile, Su Zui simply wrinkled his eyebrows and started unbuttoning his own jacket.
<br/><br/>
He said: “We didn’t bring the clothes so you should first cover yourself with my jacket and go grab your own clothes.”
　　<br/><br/>
His jacket was really too small for Fu Shijun and will definitely not fit. But to drap it and protect Fu Shijun from the cold air was still doable.
<br/><br/>
As a result, just when he unbutton the second button, his wrist was grabbed.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
“Xiao Zui——”The voice from the person who suddenly grabbed his wrist was so hoarse it was scary. It was as if a sandpaper had grinded it once.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s heart jumped and he raised his eyes to look at that pair of deep black eyes. Like it wanted to swallow him, it directly stared at him.
<br/><br/>
The hand that was restraining him was hot enough to burn someone.
　　<br/><br/>
Without a change of expression: “Don’t cause trouble. Do you want to catch a cold?”
<br/><br/>
He wanted to extract his hand from Fu Shijun’s grip but Fu Shijun grabbed him really tight this time. As if he was in a competition, the more Su Zui tried to struggle free, the tighter Fu Shiun’s grip became.
　　<br/><br/>
While he could increase his strength, but with the consideration that this person’s hand was still injured, in the end, Su Zui stopped moving.
<br/><br/>
He pursed his lips into a thin line and moved his gaze to the side. His heart felt a little distressed.
　　<br/><br/>
Although he had constantly thought about chopping off the boss’s small claws, but he didn’t plan to do it at this time.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s body was still injured. He didn’t want to make Fu Shijun too emotionally at this time.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Fu Shijun towered over and looked down at Su Zui’s clear black eyes. His focus became a bit distracted.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui......actually didn't notice anything?
　　<br/><br/>
Most of the time, he felt that Su Zui wasn’t aware at all regarding this aspect. But occasionally, he couldn’t help but second guess himself: could his small friend actually knew everything and only pretended to be stupid because he didn’t want to make things awkward?
<br/><br/>
The instant this thought arose, it became impossible to suppress it down. Like a snowball, it continued to roll and grow in his heart and grown to the point he can’t control it anymore.
　　<br/><br/>
His lips moved on its own: “Xiao Zui, I——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his head and lightly said: “Uncle Fu, you shouldn’t be impulsive.”
　　<br/><br/>
His voice was clear, like the slightly chilly clear spring by one’s feet during spring.
<br/><br/>
Except, this clear spring not only was it unable to extinguish Fu Shijun’s heat in his heart, instead i<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->t was like drinking poison to quench one’s thirst. After being calm for a short period of time, it was as it pushed him into an abyss that bind him more than before.
　　<br/><br/>
He knows——
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun suddenly understood. Su Zui had already knew about his thoughts or else he couldn’t say those words without a good reason.
　　<br/><br/>
At this moment, his brain was very clear but also very foggy. All his actions were completely relied on his instincts.
<br/><br/>
In the narrow bathroom with his upper body still naked, he used his barely moveable hand to firmly grasp Su Zui’s slender wrist and leaned over to accurately kiss the pair of soft lips.
　　<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui stood in place like an idiot. It was only after a few seconds that he blinked his eyes with difficulty.
<br/><br/>
At the start, he really did want to firmly reject Fu Shijun so much that he already mentally rehearsed his lines a couple of times.
<br/><br/>
But without knowing why, when Fu Shijun approached him, it was as if he had lost all his strength and wasn’t able to think of anything.
<br/><br/>
And just like that, he was kissed firmly by another person.
　　<br/><br/>
He hurriedly tried to breath and it was only when he felt Fu Shijun’s desire to put his tongue into his mouth that he suddenly became clear-headed and stretched his hands with the desire to push this person away.
　　<br/><br/>
As he was extending his hands to push Fu Shijun away, he talked to the system in his heart: “Buy a Forget <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->Skill Card.”
<br/><br/>
The system market has a type of skill card that would allow a person to forget part of their experiences for the past thirty minutes at random. There was still enough time if he used it on Fu Shijun right now.
<br/><br/>
When he walked out of the bathroom, Fu Shijun will forget this scene that should not have happened.
　　<br/><br/>
Maybe the absent-mindness just now wasn’t only a mishap.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s heart wasn’t simple. He may not necessarily be able to stand up straight and confess.
<br/><br/>
But no matter what, he was still a passing traveler in the end and didn’t have any qualifications to accept anyone’s feelings. He also didn’t want to......give a person an endless loneliness after he leaves.
　　<br/><br/>
It was already enough for the mistake to begin. It didn’t need to be continued.
<br/><br/>
However, just when his voice dropped, an unforeseen event suddenly happened.
<br/><br/>
Ever since he woke up, he discovered that he didn’t have any memories. His brain was a big blank space. He wasn’t able to find his origins and also wasn’t able to see his future.
<br/><br/>
But the moment Fu Shijun’s tongue forcibly entered his mouth, that blank white space was suddenly differen<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->t.
　　<br/><br/>
The white curtains broke down. Hundred and thousands of bright stars jumped out behind the curtain and revealed the real look of his mind——
<br/><br/>
Although it was a vast and boundless, but it was a starry sky filled with a loss of vitality.
　　<br/><br/>
Because Su Zui became distracted from this sudden occurrence, he forgot to push away the other person for a moment.
　　<br/><br/>
The tips of his fingers became numb. In his imaginary spiritual world, he was able to see minute data strings flow into the deep night from their connected lips and added color to his spiritual world. It also whirled around in that black starry sky in his brain, and as if it had a conscious, it cruised around the dark sky and quietly lit up a corner of the starry sky.
<br/><br/>
Although it only occupied one percent of the starry sky, but those lit up stars were as bright as gems, emitting rays of lights that allowed no one to ignore. 
　　<br/><br/>
That string of data moved too fast. Su Zui wasn’t able to catch it and read the contents, but the moment it lit up the stars, he still experienced an unprecedented rich feeling.
<br/><br/>
As if......the things that he had lost before had once again returned to his body.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui had an indescribable intuition. Even if he wasn’t able to read the contents within the stars now, when all the stars were lit up, that sealed memory will also open up to him.
<br/><br/>
“En......”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
The feeling from the spurt of data was too strange. That feeling was directly used on the spiritual plane and was more direct than a release, causing the person to be incapable of resistance.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui had never felt this type of experience. Even if his determination was strong, he can’t help but release a groan during the kiss.
　　<br/><br/>
When Fu Shijun heard his groan, it was as if he received some sort of praise. His waist was tightly drawn and he became more excited.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t have any experience or technique. He only knew to stuff his head and bump around in Su Zui’s mouth without any rhythm, as if he was beast eager to leave his mark that wanted to touch every part of the territory. He didn’t care about anything else. The fierceness was vicious.
　　<br/><br/>
If it was evaluated for its kissing technique with the full score as five stars, then he could receive a one star only on the account that he hadn’t bloodied someone from his biting. 
　　<br/><br/>
It was also because Su Zui was also inexperienced like him in this aspect and also distracted from the particular feeling from his brain that he didn’t bite Fu Shijun’s tongue and make him beat it.
　　<br/><br/>
After the messy kiss ended, Fu Shijun’s heated head finally cooled down.
<br/><br/>
As a result, once he saw the swollen lips caused by his nibbling, he once again lost his rationality. With a hoarse voice and a sudden burst of energy, he confessed: “Xiao Zui......I, I like——”
　　<br/><br/>
“Shush.”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his head and looked at him. His black eyes contained a small amount of light.
<br/><br/>
He doesn’t know whether it was because of the unforeseen event just now or he had finally given up and stopped trying to evade the feelings that had long appeared in his heart, but at this moment, he felt a never before calmness.
　　<br/><br/>
He willingly leaned closer. After he relaxed the wrinkles in between his eyebrows, he lightly said: “Kiss me again.”
<br/><br/>
As he talked, he raised his hand to touch Fu Shijun’s nape, as if he were comforting a restless big dog and coaxed: “This time, be lighter......”
　　<br/><br/>
It has to be said that his mouth really hurts a bit.
<br/><br/>
He suspects that this person is born on the year of the pig.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
