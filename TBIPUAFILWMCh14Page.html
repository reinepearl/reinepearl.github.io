								Su Zhimo took a few deep breaths before finding her voice.
<br/><br/>
She looked at Yang Yuanhang, who was forced to pathetically kneeling by others, and exposed a disdainful smile: “Mr. Yang. If you want to accuse someone, you need evidence. You can’t just say baseless lies and slander me.”
<br/><br/>
As she spoke, she turned her head to look at Su Zui and her expression was sad and pitiful: “Big brother, don’t you agree?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui had just been “slandered” by Yang Yuanhang. At this time, he is definitely capable of sympathizing with her.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui peeked out his head from behind Fu Shijun’s body and gave her a faint smile: “Let’s not talk about this. You guys can do your business. I have no interest in joining in.”
<br/><br/>
He solemnly said: “When I was slandered just now, you didn’t speak out for me. Right now, please have some self-awareness and don’t casually pull me down with you.” 
　　<br/><br/>
Pausing for a second, he innocently blinked his eyes: “Ah, that’s wrong. I forgot. Right now, the matter still isn’t clear yet. You don’t need to be in such a hurry to label yourself as ‘gotten slandered’.”
　　<br/><br/>
“Don’t mind them.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun took a few steps to the side and completely blocked Su Zui’s head from view again. He raised his chin at Su Zhimo and indifferently said: “You guys can continue.”
<br/><br/>
This attitude was the same as how one could tell the actors on stage: don’t be distracted, hurry up and finish acting.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was stupefied by these two’s shameless attitude: “......”
<br/><br/>
How can this world have such unrefined man? And there were two of them!
　　<br/><br/>
Being an absent-minded recently graduated college student, Su Zui’s attitude was barely understandable.
<br/><br/>
But Fu Shijun was a successful and well-known person in the industry! How can he be so uncourteous to ladies!
<br/><br/>
With this uncaring attitude, isn’t he afraid that people will question his morals behind his back?
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo almost became so angry that she started talking badly by these two colluding villains.
<br/><br/>
However, Yang Yuanhang didn’t give her time to be angry: “Su Zhimo, don’t quibble. The words that you had said, I have already——”
<br/><br/>
Halfway through, Yang Yuanhang’s voice ended spontaneously.
<br/><br/>
He suddenly remembered, he actually didn’t have any evidence that showed Su Zhimo directing him to come here today.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was very smart in her execution. From the start, she had only use a cell phone to communicate with him.
<br/><br/>
And those phone numbers used to contact him were always changing. It was obvious that those were not bound to a real person.
<br/><br/>
In addition, under Su Zhimo’s orders, their conversation log has also been deleted.
<br/><br/>
If they were to let him go find it right now, there was a really big chance that there wasn’t even a tiny bit of evidence left concerning Su Zhimo’s and his partnership.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang felt that his whole body was unable to itself from shivering.
<br/><br/>
If he can pull Su Zhimo under the waters, he could still used the excuse that he was bewitched.
<br/><br/>
But if it was only him, then no matter what, he couldn’t be able to explain himself.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo observed his dumbstrucked look and her mood caused by Su Zui and Fu Shijun became a bit better.
<br/><br/>
She had a teary expression and her words repeatedly hinted: “Why don’t you bring out the evidence? Mr. Yang, we had no grudges against each other in the past. To slander me like this, whoms instructions did you accept?”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang looked as if he had already lost all his reasoning skills. His blank expression did not give anyone insight on his thoughts and he also didn’t reply to her words.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo had just managed to sell pity and her heart was somewhat relieved. Just when she was about to follow up with a victory attack and release her resentment on Yang Yuanhang by keep pushing her pot to another person, Grandfather Qin used a stricter tone than before to interrupt her.
<br/><br/>
“That’s enough! Quit making a ruckus! If you have something to say, scram back home and say it! Quit making such a disgrace of yourself here! I’m tired. All of you can go back.”
<br/><br/>
These words were vague. It made people unclear whether he was cursing Su Zhimo or Yang Yuanhang, or together at the same time.
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s face became ugly again.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin hadn’t directly curse at her, but because she had been trying to be recognized as a legitimate child, her heart felt crushed.
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, she could only endure and follow Su Chengzhi home.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang indeed was not able to bring forth evidence.
<br/><br/>
Except some stuff doesn’t require precise evidence to be found.
　　<br/><br/>
After rowdy people went home, Grandfather Qin’s eyes became cold: “That Su Zhimo isn’t as stupid as her dad.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun heard this and expressed his agreement: “She is young, but her heart isn’t young.”
<br/><br/>
Completely unlike his small friend. Sometimes he can be astute, yet sometimes he can be foolish to the point that one just cannot stop worrying. He was dim-witted to the point that he was lied to by Yang Yuanhang for so long.
　　<br/><br/>
It was only then that Grandfather Qin still noticed he was present and said in surprise: “Shijun, how come you haven’t left?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun used the corner of his eyes to look at Su Zui, who was blankly staring into space, and his face didn’t change as he said: “I am worried about your health. With the stuff that just happened right now, if I did go home, I will be worrying together with my father.”
<br/><br/>
He said: “Why don’t we call the doctor to come have a look?”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin looked at Fu Shijun’s cold face and felt a bit moved.
<br/><br/>
When those nephews of his wanted something from him, they were eagerly attentive. Now that they saw him get angry for real, each and every one of them left in haste, as if afraid that if they leave a bit slower, he will take out his anger on them.
<br/><br/>
Not one of them thought about his old age and whether or not he will suffer from the anger caused by this rotten mess.
　　<br/><br/>
Compare to these blood is thicker than water relatives, an outsider was more sincere than them in the end.
　　<br/><br/>
The gaze he directed toward Fu Shijun became more affectionate: “You don’t need to go so far. Truthfully, my body has been way better lately. You should hurry back and also tell your father that he doesn’t need to worry about me.”
　　<br/><br/>
He doesn’t know whether or not it was because his grandson was finally becoming more capable that his mood became more relaxed.
<br/><br/>
These days, his mind has become better day by day.
<br/><br/>
Vaguely, he felt as if he returned back to thirty years ago and regained a vast amount of energy to waste.

<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Yang Yuanhang procrastinated to the final day before getting forcefully thrown out by the people Su Zui sent over.
<br/><br/>
The clothes belonging to him were also thrown out in a mess.
<br/><br/>
Even the vegetables Mother Yang brought from home were rolling on the ground. It was a pathetic and ridiculous sight.
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang continuously wiped her tears at the side: “Yuanhang. Quickly think of a way. I have painstakingly raised you up. I can’t return home with such humilation……”
<br/><br/>
While she might be strong, but the people who were forcing them to move out were taller and stronger.
<br/><br/>
Wearing black suits and a cold solemn expression, they made her unable to voice a single complaint. 
　　<br/><br/>
She could only dare to charge at her son and bawl: “Didn’t you say everything will be fine? The things that you had said, none of it became true!”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang haven’t taken care of himself for the past three days. His whole person was messy and muddleheaded.
<br/><br/>
He was originally inattentively standing there, but after hearing Mother Su’s complaint, he suddenly thought of something. His eyes became bright as he charged toward the villa: “Wait, I still have things that I haven’t brought out!”
　　<br/><br/>
He had actually forgotten about the gifts that Su Zui sent him!”
<br/><br/>
While the depreciation of the luxury goods made one hurt, but it was better than not having anything at all.
<br/><br/>
If he sold the stuff that Su Zui gave him, he can still pool together several millions.
　　<br/><br/>
Thinking of this, Yang Yuanhang suddenly didn’t feel much despair.
<br/><br/>
He thought that as long as he relied on that wealth and cut down on his spending, he can still live comfortably for a few years.
<br/><br/>
And in those few years, he can also think of methods to find an exit.
　　<br/><br/>
Very quickly, he was blocked by a person.
<br/><br/>
“Apologizes, under Mr. Su’s orders, you can only bring away your clothes and documents. The remaining items cannot be taken away.”
　　<br/><br/>
Even the last road was blocked. Yang Yuanhang staggered a few steps before steadying himself with the tree trunk.
<br/><br/>
The palm of his hand was cut from the coarse tree trunk and blood flowed out of the injury.
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang also felt despair in her heart and wailed: “What about that Su Zhimo? Didn’t you say you already worked it out with her? Where is she now? Quickly go find her!”
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang bitterly laughed.
<br/><br/>
What’s the use of finding her?
<br/><br/>
As soon as he pointed at Su Zhimo at the scene that day, the relationship between him and Su Zhimo can no longer be benevolent.
<br/><br/>
With him like this right now, it was already good that Su Zhimo didn’t take the opportunity to kick him down. How could she help him?
　　<br/><br/>
After leaving Su Zhimo, Yang Yuanhang’s brain suddenly became clear and his IQ slowly came back online.
<br/><br/>
He perplexedly looked at everything and cannot understand how he was not satisfied with how Su Zui treated him in the beginning and promised to scheme against Su Zui with Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
If he didn’t promise Su Zhimo, will he be able to still live in that luxurious villa and warmly joke with that clear and soft looking youth right now?
　　<br/><br/>
Endless regret rosed from his heart, as if wrapping his heart in a vast darkness.
<br/><br/>
But it was already too late for regrets.
<br/><br/>
This world may have regret medicine, except that he will never be able to obtain it.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Meanwhile, a very familiar mission notification noise sounded in Su Zui’s ears.
　　<br/><br/>
[Ding! Main mission 1: Cannon fodder vengeance. Completion status: 80%]
<br/><br/>
[Novice’s early reward system had already transferred 2000 experience points to your account; please make sure it has been received!]
　　<br/><br/>
The first 20% was because he made Yang Yuanhang wear a green hat.
<br/><br/>
The second 20% was because Yang Yuanhang’s mother caught him with another man in bed.
<br/><br/>
These two were actually retaliations created from the original’s bitter experience.
　　<br/><br/>
The third and the fourth was different since it originated from Yang Yuanhang’s frustration and his inability to repent. 　　
<br/><br/>
Then the remaining 20% will probably be gained after Yang yuanhang completely lose his standing and is unable to climb up from the mud ever again.
<br/><br/>
The system bluntly asked: “Host, only one fifth remains. What will you do next?”
<br/><br/>
Yet, Su Zui shook his head and said: “We don’t need to bother with it.”
<br/><br/>
Being this type of person, Yang Yuanhang was only able to live so comfortably because the original was blind.
<br/><br/>
If the things that don’t belong to him are all stripped away, even if he doesn’t do anything, Yang Yuanhang will still dig his own grave.
　　<br/><br/>
Throwing this expired slag to the back of his mind, Su Zui touched his cell phone and considered another matter.
<br/><br/>
The boss had tactfully helped him several times. He wasn’t used to owning people favors and should carefully consider how he should repay this annoying debt.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
<br/><br/>
Annoying Spirit: Why don’t you give your heart to me! (╯°▽°)╯*

Zui Zui: ? ? ?
