Because Yang Yuanhang’s leg was injured, he didn’t have the time or the heart to clean the house. In merely a few days, the small basement became dirty and smelly. The concentrated smell could be smelled without even entering the door. The next door neighbors cannot help but seek the landlord to protest a few times, so much so that two tenants moved out due to this matter.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
When it was time to pay rent, the landlord was unwilling to continue renting the house to him no matter what he said, and even yelled at him with an ironed expression. The more vulgar the yelling could be, the more vulgar it became.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was yelled at until he became ashamed to the point he didn’t dare show his face. With his heart full of anger, he hated that he couldn’t directly immediately charge in and fight with the landlord!
<br/><br/>
But the landlord was tall and sturdy. His face looked fierce and his body was full of muscles. Even his arm was full of tattoos. With just a glance, people knew that he wasn’t someone to mess with.
　　<br/><br/>
Don’t even talk about fighting. Yang Yuanhang was so startled throughout the whole process that he didn’t even dare to mutter a single word and was kicked out with his stuff just like that. 
　　<br/><br/>
He wanted to find a new place to rent but his sloppy appearance wasn’t very welcoming. The landlord considered their soon to be paying rent tenants’ feelings and wasn’t willing to rent a room to him.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang slept in a moist and cold hotel for two nights before ultimately deciding that there wasn’t any way and used a low dejected voice to call Mother Yang.
<br/><br/>
Mother Yang pushed her small handcart and swear while talking as she brought him back.
<br/><br/>
Although she hated that Yang Yuanhang made her lost respect amongst the adults, but Yang Yuanhang was her only son. If she still wanted someone to pay respect and burn paper offerings to her in the future, she couldn’t really let Yang Yuanhang lay on the road and wait for death.
　　<br/><br/>
Regardless of her swearing, she still pulled Yang Yuanhang, who had a deep face and an injured leg, on the small handcart until they reached the village.
　　<br/><br/>
The making of the small handcart was very crude. Not only does it chaff the skin, there were also many barbs on the surface. When Yang Yuanhang laid on the surface, he couldn’t feel a single comfortable place on his body.
<br/><br/>
But compared to not feeling comfortable, what made him feel more painful <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->was the dense feeling of defeat in his heart.
　　<br/><br/>
He looked down on this mountain village that he grew up in. In his dreams, one of his worst nightmares was that he couldn’t able to make a name for himself in the cities and thus was forced to return to this place and lived the rest of his empty life with these uncultured and inexperienced villagers while spending his entire days farming.
<br/><br/>
But it wasn’t that he planned on never returning in his entire life.
<br/><br/>
Due to his mother’s imbued ideology since young, he had oftenly thought about the matter of returning home in glory.
　　<br/><br/>
Ever since the first day he left this place to go to college, his heart thought of this scenario: during Chinese New Year or any other festivals, he could drive his new car, get off his car while wearing a set of bright and beautiful clothing, and have a random gift in his hands that these poor villagers couldn’t buy even if they saved for a year.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
When everyone looked at him, they wouldn't be able to restrain the envy in their eyes. The people who looked down on him in the past could only try to win his favor to him now.
<br/><br/>
But a few years have past and the reality was that one of his legs became slanted, he was sitting on top of his mother’s wooden handcart, his whole body stank, and he was pulled home like a commodity.
　　<br/><br/>
Don’t even talk about returning home in glory. Even the posture of the people who went out to work in laborius conditions were better than him.
<br/><br/>
At least, their body was healthy and strong and can laugh while walking back.
　　<br/><br/>
He endured the humiliation as he stepped down from the cart. Without even moving a few steps with his crutches, he met a few troublemaking chattering children wearing coarse clothing. 
　　<br/><br/>
The children couldn’t recognize him but once they smelled his odor, they puckered up their nose and gathered together to avoid him.
　　<br/><br/>
Someone said: “This person is so smelly. Let’s move farther away from him or else we might also turn smelly!”
<br/><br/>
Amongst the group, there was a red nosed child who remembered a grievous matter: “My mom won’t let me become smelly or else my butt will be spanked once I get home! Last time I was playing in the mud and then I got yelled at by my mom. Wuwuwu<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>……”
　　<br/><br/>
Amongst the group, the only girl became incessantly nervous and softly said: “Is he a beggar? I saw a beggar once. They would steal other people’s stuff to eat. Let’s go. We’ll go around the woods. He looks so scary……”
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Hearing these children not even trying to cover their words of “smelly” and also unblinkingly took him as a beggar, Yang Yuanhang was almost unable to hold back his anger at that moment.
　　<br/><br/>
He looked at that group of impoverished and uneducated children and fiercely cursed: “Animal born from a mother but wasn’t raised by one!”
　　<br/><br/>
Although the children were young, but they could still understand curse words. With the addition of his fiendish face, he doesn’t look like a good person no matter what!
<br/><br/>
A boy, who had a big temper, saw him cursing at them and temporarily forgot the matter to go around him. He stood there and returned his cursing in a loud voice.
　　<br/><br/>
“Smelly beggar!”
<br/><br/>
“You are the one who is an animal! And a stinky animal! So stinky like you just walked out of a poop pond!”
　　<br/><br/>
Although Yang Yuanhang was an adult, but he only had a pair of mouth. When the group of children suddenly surrounded him and cursed him, he was unable to retort.
<br/><br/>
As he was yelled at, his face became swollen red and his heart felt oppre<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->ssed. Just as he was about to use his crutches to scare away this group of brats, his crutches were suddenly grabbed by a force and pulled backwards.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang immediately fell onto the ground and pain burst in that injured leg. No matter what, he was unable to stand and flopped onto the ground, covered with dust.
　　<br/><br/>
A middle-aged woman appeared from who knows when from the side and hugged one of the children in the group. With an expression more fierce than Yang Yuanhang’s, she spitted on his face.
<br/><br/>
Besides working, the villager women were the most nimble at cursing people. Catching Yang Yuanhang was the same as putting a gun to his chest and cursed him until blood burst from his head.
<br/><br/>
“You are the animal who doesn’t have a mother raising you! Where did this bum come from! To even bully small children!”
　　<br/><br/>
“Oh…...I was just thinking why you look so familiar. Aren’t you that son from Old Yang’s family who lied to a lady for marriage? You still have the face to come back? If I were you, I would first knock my own head against a stone to give some name back to my family!”
　　<br/><br/>
“Do you want to go see your banner? It’s hung in the woods. These few months were just the right time for peaches to ripen. Every single time we go to pick fruits, we can see it very very clear!”
　　<br/><br/>
“Baby, don’t play with this pervert. If you look at him a few more times, you will also be infected and turn into a pervert!”
　　<br/><br/>
After the middle-aged woman finished cursing, she carried her child and walked away with a snort. The remaining children pointed at Yang Yuanhang and imitated what they saw and said a few phrases of pervert before scattering.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was yelled at until waves of dizziness hit his brain. With <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->the pain on his body, he struggled on the floor for a really long time before getting supported by Mother Yang, who had just finished pulling her cart, home.
<br/><br/>
Knowing what he had just experienced, Mother Yang didn’t express anything and only gave him a gloomy glance before doing her own stuff.
　　<br/><br/>
A village’s life was very bitter. It was more bitter than the time Yang Yuanhang lived in the basement.
<br/><br/>
It was poor at home. Mother Yang was very frugal. Food and clothing were picked due to their cheap price. In just a few days, Yang Yuanhang couldn’t endure it anymore and threw an anger tantrum when he looked at the vegetables in his bowl.
　　<br/><br/>
But Mother Yang had lost all of her patience a long time ago. Once she saw him making an unnecessary racket, she directly became more ferocious than him and yelled at him. After she gave his brain a couple slaps, she directly took away the bowl in front of him. If he doesn’t want to eat, then don’t eat!
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was starved for one day.His brain became dizzy from hunger and didn’t dare to say anything in the future. Whatever Mother Yang made, he obediently ate it.
　　<br/><br/>
Besides not eating well, another thing that made Yang Yuanhang felt pain was that he still had to work!
<br/><br/>
His leg wasn’t good and wasn’t able to do any farming. Mother Yang pushed all the house chores onto him. What sweep the floor, pick vegetables, feed the chickens, feed the pigs. It was extremely dirty.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
But Yang Yuanhang didn’t dare to not work because if he doesn’t work, Mother Yang will starve him.
　　<br/><br/>
Although he was oftenly treated like a slave by Mother Yang, but if Yang Yuanhang didn’t need to go out, he still prefers to not go out.
<br/><br/>
Because everytime he goes out, he could meet villagers who could point fingers at him.
　　<br/><br/>
These people’s faces were full of disgust. When they saw him come near, they would exaggeratedly keep away, as if he was some kind of plague and could get sick just by being near him for a tiny bit.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang simply didn’t go out to avoid self humiliation. But even like this, it didn’t stop people throwing rocks at their home in the middle of the night. The window glass had already been broken a few times.
　　<br/><br/>
Just like this, a few months passed before a good thing happened.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The injury in Yang Yuanhang’s legs finally became more stable. Although it was still slanted, but it at the very least, he didn’t need to rely on crutches to walk anymore.
　　<br/><br/>
His mood finally became a bit better. He grabbed his long time unused cellphone and scroll around in his friend circle and suddenly discovered that a few classmates from before had opened their own offices. On the long term recruit list, there were those that paid below average and those that paid above average. As long as there was internet access, then anyone can do it.
　　<br/><br/>
Before, Yang Yuanhang looked down on working online and felt that this will only drop his social status. But when he looked at these work now, he found out that this will probably be his only way out.
　　<br/><br/>
Although he treated these classmates with disdain before and refused to understand their likes, but it wasn’t that hateful. In the end, they were still classmates. Now that he lowered himself to ask for a job, they couldn’t just ignore him.
<br/><br/>
As a result, Yang Yuanhang put down his arrogance and went to those classmates and tactfully expressed that he can do some freelance work.
<br/><br/>
The result was less than satisfactory.
<br/><br/>
[Oh sorry Yuanhang. We already have enough people for the time being.]
<br/><br/>
[Really sorry Old Yang. My company temporarily doesn’t need it. If there’s an opportunity next time, I’ll think of you.]
<br/><br/>
[The market has been saturated recently. We really can’t recruit anymore. Why don’t you go to xx to ask?]
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
He continuously asked a few people but were met with rejection without exception.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang felt that something wasn’t right but the reasons these people gave were all dignified. If he continued asking, they would pretend to be stupid and gave blank answers or they would refuse to continue talking to him.
　　<br/><br/>
So much that there were people who became annoyed with his questioning and directly put him on the black list without any sensitivity.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang became more impatient. He was very sure that something must have happened without him knowing!
<br/><br/>
He almost asked all his classmates before finally, a classmate finally gave him some classmate sympathy and used an anonymous account to tell him the truth.
　　<br/><br/>
[Yuanhang, the matter about you being a homosexual and lying for marriage had been forwarded to our school forum a month ago by someone. You…...it’s better if you stop asking. Everyone also wants face.]
　　<br/><br/>
Bam. Yang Yuanhang’s cellphone fell from his hand and to the floor. The screen cracked with a deep mark.
