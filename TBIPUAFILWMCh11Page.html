								After returning from the welcoming dinner, Grandfather Qin personally called Fu Shijun and invited him over.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t Fu Shijun unexpectantly helping Su Zui in passing the proposal, then he’s afraid that Su Zui could have already been labeled as “incapable” just now.
　　<br/><br/>
While their family and Fu family’s relationship is good, but a big part of it is due to his and Grandfather Qin’s personal friendship. In actuality, the younger generation aren’t that close.
<br/><br/>
For Fu Shijun to help Su Zui to this degree, regardless of reason, he still needs to express his thanks.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun didn’t shirk and delightfully agreed to eat a home cooked meal at Qin family’s home in two days.
　　<br/><br/>
Under Grandfather Qin’s orders, all the servant in the Qin family became busy for the arrival of the precious guest.
<br/><br/>
On the appointed day, Grandfather Qin pulled Su Zui and his uncles to the living room to wait.
　　<br/><br/>
At this time, a sudden phone call arrived.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin had thought it was Fu Shijun and quickly took out his cellphone, only to find out it was Su Chengzhi. His face quickly became cold.
<br/><br/>
He impatiently picked it up: “What is it?”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi opened his mouth and said: “Father-in-law, I heard today that you have invited Mr. Fu over to thank him on behalf of Xiao Zui. How can you not inform me at all? As his father, I need to be present too in this formal event.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin coldly snorted: “You know how to be Xiao Zui’s father at this time? How come you didn’t remember when he left!”
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi thickened his face and said: “How can there be grudges between father and son? Didn’t I only say those words in a moment of anger? I am already at the entrance. Please open the door to let me in<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin choked by his feeling of disgust and directly hanged up.
<br/><br/>
Just when he prepared to order the bodyguards to chase Su Chengzhi away, he heard a servant reported: “Mr. Fu’s car had just arrived. Mr. Su is also at the door.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin paused for a moment before unwillingly said: “Invite them all in.”
<br/><br/>
In front of guests, he doesn’t want to stir up any arguments and disrespect his guests.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi quickly came in after Fu Shijun.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
What was unexpected was that not only did he came, but also brought another person!
<br/><br/>
When Grandfather Qin looked at Su Zhimo’s face, his blood pressure directly rose up and almost used his old arms to hit someone right on the spot.
　　<br/><br/>
He invited a precious guest to dinner for his blood related grandson. Su Zhimo being a mistress’s daughter, who gave her enough face to come to this type of event?
<br/><br/>
But with Fu Shijun present, he didn’t lose control of himself and can only slowly press down on his anger and pretend Su Zhimo was empty air.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi was totally unaware of how mentally retarded he was acting and pushed Su Zhimo forward: “Xiao Zui. You haven’t seen your sister for so long. Did you think of her?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
He indifferently ignored the words made by the person wearing the green hat. His gaze passed by the father and daughter pair and gave Fu Shijun a smile.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s gaze stayed on his dimples for a while before saying: “Apologies. I let you guys wait. If I hadn’t got off late tonight, I could have gotten here earlier.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “It was no bother. Eating at this time is still early.”
　　<br/><br/>
Speaking to his son yet getting no response at all, Su Chengzi’s face cannot help but became green: “......” 
　　<br/><br/>
On the contrary, Su Zhimo’s face was indifferent and didn’t expose anything.
<br/><br/>
Today, she dressed herself bright and colorful enough to move people as she did before. Her skin was porcelain white and tender. Standing under the lights, she looked as if she was born to attract the other sex’s gaze.
　　<br/><br/>
Yet, the two young handsome male present were already minding their own businesses and exchanging pleasantries with each other without giving her a single look.
　　<br/><br/>
When had Su Zhimo been ignored to this degree? Her heart was full of discontent.
<br/><br/>
But remembering her purpose today, she quickly raised her spirits.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
She looked at the dressed up Su Zui looking noble and proud, and her eyes flashed with disdain.
<br/><br/>
Even if one wrapped themselves with precious gemstones, it couldn’t cover up the defects. 
　　<br/><br/>
With the precious guest’s arrival, the dinner quickly started.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin used his tea as a replacement for wine to toast to Fu Shijun: “My grandson is still falling short. In the future, I will still need to trouble you to take care of him. Xiao Zui, you should also toast your Uncle Fu a cup.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui held a wine glass. His expression was as obedient as it could be and said: “Thank you uncle.”
　　<br/><br/>
Normally, Fu Shijun couldn’t accept the activity of guiding the younger generation because it was too much trouble.
<br/><br/>
But this time was different.
<br/><br/>
He drank the glass of wine directly: “What trouble? This is how it should be.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin haven’t said anything before Su Zui’s oldest uncle suddenly cut in: “You can’t say it like that President Fu.”
<br/><br/>
He smiled as if he was very concerned for Fu Shijun and said: “Taking care of the younger generation is a good thing, but President Fu also needs to consider your own benefit. You mustn’t compensate too much in the end or as Xiao Zui’s relatives, we could feel very apologetic.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s warm voice said: “Uncle, you also can’t say with such certainty. Brother has been working hard lately. What if he has done well?”
　　<br/><br/>
That day when she discovered Fu Shijun passed Su Zui’s proposal, she had indeed panicked for a while.
<br/><br/>
But after thinking it thoroughly, she became calm.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was just a layman who had ventured out of his cave. Even if he worked with his life, how can the proposal he made be any good?
<br/><br/>
It’s most likely that Fu Shijun had considered Grandfather Qin’s face so he passed Su Zui’s proposal.
　　<br/><br/>
In reality, Grandfather Qin must have also understand how the proposal was passed in his heart.
<br/><br/>
Otherwise, he couldn’t hold such a grand feast at home for Fu Shijun.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo laughed coldly in her heart.
<br/><br/>
She had especially pestered Su Chengzhi to bring her along to the Qin family was because she wanted to see how Su Zui would look like after the curtain has been lifted!
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun can help him once or twice, but once there wasn’t anyone to help, being a talentless trash, Su Zui will inevitably decompose in mud as his fate dictates.
　　<br/><br/>
Immediately, there was someone agreeing with Su Zhimo: “That’s right. Big brother, you can’t always attack children’s enthusiasm. If the first time isn’t successful, there’s always the second time. If the second time isn’t successful, there’s always the third time!”
　　<br/><br/>
This person magnanimously said to Fu Shijun: “How about this? President Fu, this time I will invest in Xiao Zui’s proposal. You don’t need to hesitate on its execution. Whatever you earn is yours and I will pay for the loss. We can’t have you do stuff for free and loss money.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo smiled while saying: “I had earned a somewhat decent amount of money from investing before and can also help out.”
　　<br/><br/>
Someone asked: “How much is somewhat decent?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo faintly laughed: “Not much. It’s had only passed a million.”
<br/><br/>
To the people sitting in this table, this number undoubtedly doesn’t count as anything.
<br/><br/>
But it was enough to pull around the same age Su Zui into the mud.
　　<br/><br/>
The original person who was casually asking had some surprised in their eyes: “That isn’t bad. Zhimo hadn’t even graduated yet and she’s already so talented. In the future, she will definitely have boundless prospects!”
<br/><br/>
“And to know how to help with brother’s worries. Family should be just like this and mutually help each other out.”
<br/><br/>
“Su Zui, don’t you think so?”
　　<br/><br/>
The suddenly cued Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
He politely raised his eyebrow and looked at his who knows which uncle a glance.
<br/><br/>
Then he continued to eat the food on his plate.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
The ignored uncle: “......”
　　<br/><br/>
With a lack of interest, Su Zui ridiculed to the system: “Will they die if they don’t talk in a roundabout way?”
<br/><br/>
Every single phrase needs to circle around a hundred times. Praises on the surface, but criticizing him underneath. 
<br/><br/>
As if when their malicious words hit the mark, it proves that he was really incapable.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was too lazy to join in with their acting and concentrate his attention on eating.
<br/><br/>
Suddenly, a warm item was placed near the back of his hand.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his head and saw a cup of tea steeped by Fu Shijun at who knows when had been pushed to his side.
<br/><br/>
A faint warmth transferred from the thin cup into his body.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun said in a low voice: “Drink some tea and don’t eat so quickly, or you might accidentally get oily.”
<br/><br/>
Seeing Su Zui acting the same as a hamster stuffing his cheek with food, it looked exactly like an animal storing food to pass the winter.
<br/><br/>
He was really afraid his small friend will continue to eat and eat, and accidentally stuff himself.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui blinked his eyes and said: “Thank you uncle.”
<br/><br/>
He picked up the tea and took a sip.
<br/><br/>
The temperature was just right. The light fragrance from the tea filled his mouth and took away the oily feeling from the food.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun also picked up some vegetables for him: “Your stomach isn’t in a good condition. Eat more easily digestible food.”
<br/><br/>
After eating and drinking his fill, Su Zui still had a person to serve him. He clasped the tea cup and cozily closed his eyes: “......Ok.”
　　<br/><br/>
Out of the two, one person was responsible for getting food, another person was responsible for eating. The atmosphere was ordinary, yet it was incomparably harmonious. 
<br/><br/>
But the people left out weren’t that comfortable.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
What were the greatest joy for criticizers? 
<br/><br/>
Was it the process of slapping the other person’s face?
<br/><br/>
No! It was after they finished talking, they get to calmly enjoy the mocked person’s awkward expression in the midst of the chaos!
　　<br/><br/>
But now, the person they were mocking were not only indifferent to their mocking, but also pretend to not hear them when they mention his name!
<br/><br/>
Everything before had already been spread out, yet the highlight was not arriving.
<br/><br/>
This type of using their whole strength to strike at cotton feeling was simply enough to choke them to death!
　　<br/><br/>
Under his daughter’s subtle notion, Su Chengzhi opened his mouth to reprimand him: “Xiao Zui, your uncles were talking to you! With such concerns, how can you only lower your head and eat! You aren’t a bit sensible!”
　<br/><br/>
Immediately, there were people artificially trying to mediate the situation.
<br/><br/>
“Aiya, don’t be angry. Don’t be angry. Small children need face. We all understand that he will become sensible after growing up.”
<br/><br/>
“When I was young, I wanted more face than Xiao Zui. When someone dares to say I didn’t do a good drop, I had to retaliate against them. Whoever tries to stop me never had a good result!”
<br/><br/>
“It’s fine. It’s fine. You too Xiao Zui. Don’t always be so shy. No one wants to harm you. As elders, we are only doing it for your own good.”
　　<br/><br/>
The more they talk, the more outrageous it became.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s eyes flashed with faint displeasure.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
He once again steeped another cup of tea for Su Zui before raising his eyebrows and said: “If it’s only investment you need, that’s fine. My company doesn’t lack that small amount of money. It isn’t necessary to bicker about one million and eight hundred thousand.”
<br/><br/>
He paused for a moment before saying: “Moreover, the proposal had already been executed. The results from the initial stage was very good. We had already decided to continue executing it on a larger scale. If everything goes well, the company’s performance for this period will be raised seven percent.”
　　<br/><br/>
While seven percent doesn’t sound like a big number, but you have to know, for the Fu Corporation, this type of huge monster, to have a growth of less than one percent was still a huge amount of wealth that was hard for ordinary people to imagine.
　　<br/><br/>
This praise was simply ridiculous.
<br/><br/>
But the person talking was Fu Shijun, the person in charge of Fu Corporation. He had a very reliable behavior, and was simply impossible for him to lie to others using these fake sounding words.
　　<br/><br/>
Originally peacefully watching from the sidelines, Su Zhimo’s expression became rigid.
<br/><br/>
She took out her cellphone and pretended to talk to other people while secretly searched online.
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, she found that the latest marketing strategy executed by Fu Corporation had only been implemented for two days before receiving an explosive effect.
<br/><br/>
Without even arriving at the final stage, there were already many businessmen expressing their admiration of how this plan can become a textbook example or a research study in the future.  
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo bit her lip hard. Her heart beat like stormy waves.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
She had heard that the Fu Corporation had some movement, but she completely didn’t expect that this big promotion activity had stemmed from the proposal created by that wasted brother of hers!
<br/><br/>
How can this happen?!
　　<br/><br/>
The things she was able to search up, of course other people can search up too.
<br/><br/>
Looking up from their cellphone, for a period of time, everyone had an indescribable expression.
<br/><br/>
If one were to describe it, it could probably be the awkwardness and unsightly expression after swallowing a hundred flies.
　　<br/><br/>
Even Grandfather Qin have some disbelieve: “Shijun, is this really true?”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nodded toward him and said: “Since the proposal haven’t finished executing yet, I was originally not going to say anything. But since everyone is so interested, I’ll mention something. Xiao Zui’s proposal’s worth is very high. Being part of Fu Corporation’s stockholder, I am very thankful to him.”
　　<br/><br/>
After he finished talking, originally everyone felt as if they had swallowed a hundred flies can only feel as if they were forced to swallow another hundred fly larvaes. 
<br/><br/>
The whole room was quiet. Not a single person dared to open their mouth.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
