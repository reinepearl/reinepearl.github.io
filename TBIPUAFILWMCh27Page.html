								Xu Yanyan hurriedly filled her eyes with tears and frantically tried to explain: “I, I was only doing it with good intentions……”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face completely became dark: “Go out.”
　　<br/><br/>
His voice wasn’t loud, so much that it couldn’t even be classified as strict. However, the deep voice carried a taint of coldness that could freeze one on the spot.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Xu Yanyan could read the latter half of Fu Shijun’s unsaid sentence from those two short words——
<br/><br/>
If she dared to complain tearfully, she doesn’t even need to transfer anymore. She can directly beat it!
　　<br/><br/>
Although her heart was full of grievances, but once she thought of the serious consequences after getting fired, Xu Yanyan still contained her tears and became silent.
<br/><br/>
The corner of her eyes became red and her tears fell down. She answered while sobbing: “Pres-President Fu, I understand. It was me that was wrong. I’ll leave now.”
<br/><br/>
She looked delicate. When she cried, it didn’t look hideous. Instead, it made her look somewhat delicate and graceful. It was a look that easily arouse people’s sympathy.
　　<br/><br/>
However, it was regretful that ever since President Fu was born, the phrase “have protective feelings for the fair sex” has never been in his dictionary.
<br/><br/>
So much that when he was faced with Xu Yanyan’s neat and pitiful posture, he felt it was very irksome.
<br/><br/>
This type of crying once they are faced with a problem employee was really not too useful.
　　<br/><br/>
Once he finished talking, he acted as if Xu Yanyan was air. With a warm voice, he turned his head and said to Su Zui, who had his head lowered and was very focused in studying his document: “Xiao Zui, come here. I suddenly remembered that there is still a place that needs change.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Su Zui handed over his opened document and faintly smiled: “I already discovered it. Look, is it this place?”
　　<br/><br/>
In front of Su Zui, Fu Shijun can be rated as the world's most considerate teacher.
<br/><br/>
Without even receiving the document in hand, his mouth already started praising as if he was sure everything was correct: “Is that so? Xiao Zui is very impressive.”
　　<br/><br/>
The man, who was just using sarcasm to threaten her, had turned his head and used a light voice to coax another person. Faced with this type of intense difference, as long as they were a human, their heart wouldn’t feel comfortable.
<br/><br/>
The unwillingness and grievances in Xu Yanyan’s heart mingled together. Unable to continue staying in the office any longer, she tearfully turned around to leave.
　　<br/><br/>
“Peng——”
<br/><br/>
A muffled sound suddenly sounded in the office as Xu Yanyan turned her body.
<br/><br/>
It turned out that when Xu Yanyan turned her body too frenetically and her elbow accidentally knocked over the teacup on top of the desk, and caused the tea to spill out.
<br/><br/>
The document that just arrived in Fu Shijun’s hands just happened to come in contact with the tea. The paper quickly became crumpled as it soaked in the tea, causing the annotated notes to become runny and indistinct.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
But this wasn’t the most serious part.
<br/><br/>
The most serious part was that part of the brown tea spilled onto Fu Shijun’s body.
<br/><br/>
The ironed black suit was dyed with water marks. From the chest to the lower abdomen was a wide span of brown color. It was a sudden and monstrous appearance.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face already became black to the point one can’t see the bottom.
<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan also didn’t think this mishap will happen and became so scared that she forgot to continue crying: “I’m so sorry President Fu! I didn’t intentionally——”
<br/><br/>
As she talked, she frantically pulled out napkins from the tissue box and prepared to wipe Fu Shijun’s cloth.
　　<br/><br/>
Just when she was about to come in contact with Fu Shijun, a white and slender hand suddenly came from the side and lightly block her hand.
<br/><br/>
Her gaze followed that hand upwards and saw Su Zui already standing from his seat.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s expression was indifferent: “President Fu’s ar<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->m is injured. Don’t continue to cause trouble. Go out.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but Su Zui’s eyes were ice cold. When the gaze fell on her, it brought a terrifying feeling. It wasn’t any weaker than the gaze Fu Shijun gave her just now.
<br/><br/>
She can’t help but bolted.
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui blocked Xu Yanyan’s hand, he brought out his own napkins and wiped Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun still wanted to have some self-reliance: “I’ll do——”
<br/><br/>
Without a trace of politeness, Su Zui pushed away the hand that was reaching for the napkins: “The injured person should sit still and not move. The place where you got injured was your arm. We should be going to the hospital right now.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s pushed away hand stopped in midair. Finally, he let it lightly fall down beside his body and lowered his head to look at the youth before his eyes, who was single-mindedly helping him wipe away the water stains from his cloth.
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui finished wiping away the brown spots from Fu Shijun’s suit jacket, he paused for a moment to take a clear look, before stretching his hand and started to remove the buttons on Fu Shijun’s jacket.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun sensed his intentions. His pupil shrunk for a split second. In a deep voice, he said: “You don’t need to do this part.”
　　<br/><br/>
“You can’t. Even the inside is soaked,” Su Zui was very persistent: “It needs to be wiped clean.”
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Fu Shijun lowered his head to take a look, and can’t help but pursed his bottom lip.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s hands were originally white. Contrasted against his black suit, it was as if his hands were emitting light. Su Zui’s slender fingertips grabbed onto his buttons. Even though the intention was proper, but in Fu Shijun’s eyes, it was really hard to remain calm like before.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was aware of his peculiar expression, but pretended as if he didn’t see anything and continued his handiwork.
<br/><br/>
He knew, if he didn’t have any intentions to be together with Fu Shijun, it was best if he didn’t do action that will make people misunderstand.
　　<br/><br/>
But Fu Shijun can only use one arm right now. With his clumsy actions, it was very easy to have an accident if he were to do things himself.
<br/><br/>
To avoid arousing suspicion, he had to look at things with a detached point of view. It can’t be helped if it became too cold blooded.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun didn’t say anything. He quickly opened up the buttons on Fu Shijun’s suit jacket.
<br/><br/>
As he expected, the white blouse inside was also soaked.
<br/><br/>
From the collar bone down to the abdomen, there were traces of tea. After it has been stained with water, the blouse became half transparent and stuck to the body. It had lost its fundamental use of coverage.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Through the light layer, Su Zui was able to clearly see the curve of Fu Shijun’s muscles beneath the shirt. The area that was meant to be tight was tight. The area that was meant to be smooth was smooth. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the lines were very elegant. Separated by a half soaked shirt, it was more torturous to people than not wearing anything at all. The hormones seemed to be trying to outdo each other as they throw themselves at people.
<br/><br/>
If it was an indecisive lady or maybe a schoolboy that was present, there was an eighty percent change that they would already yell “I’m willing”, and charged forward.
　　<br/><br/>
But Su Zui wasn’t that easy to be seduced by beauty.
<br/><br/>
His gaze slightly stopped for a moment on that beautiful scenery before he focused on his hand movements.
<br/><br/>
But after wiping two times, he stopped his hand and wrinkled his eyebrows.
<br/><br/>
He thought for a while before saying: “I’ll bring you to the bathroom. Your body should also be soaked. If we continue like this, it will be too troublesome. Why don’t we directly clean your upper body and also give you a change of cloth.
<br/><br/>
Almost the entire area of Fu Shijun’s abdomen was soaked. Using the limited amount of his napkins to wipe was not only troublesome but also cannot wipe Fu Shijun dry.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had a small room in his company right next to th<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->e CEO office for emergencies. Bathroom, kitchen, bed......everything was there. He would occasionally go over at noon to take a nap. To go and wipe down his body wasn’t any trouble.
　　<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
Hearing Su Zui’s suggestion, Fu Shijun’s mind became empty for a split second. He opened his mouth but wasn’t able to say anything.
<br/><br/>
Because they were only separated by a blouse when Su Zui nonchalantly wiped his body a couple of times, he can't help but tighten his abdomen and became absent-minded.
<br/><br/>
If he was to be naked in front of the other, he really can’t be sure that he can still remain calm.
<br/><br/>
Although his core was still there, and his muscles hasn’t gone so far as to disappear completely, but it was definitely not like the condition it normally was.
<br/><br/>
Once he imagined how he has to expose his declined body to Su Zui, it was as if someone stepped on his tail. From head to toe, he felt distressed.
　　<br/><br/>
But Su Zui didn’t show any consideration towards his complicated mood and directly gathered up his suit jacket. Without blinking his eyes, he emotionlessly urged: “Hurry. Don’t get lost in thought. We need to finish this quickly. The weather is cold. Don’t catch a cold.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “......”
<br/><br/>

								In this context, it basically meant that he told the company he is going on “vacation” but went to accompany and work with Fu Shijun instead. Another example where you dove someone is calling in sick for work but in reality, they are playing games at home ^-^;;;
