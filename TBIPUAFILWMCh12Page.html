								In the end, it was Grandfather Qin who opened his mouth to break the silence.
<br/><br/>
He lightly coughed: “Shijun, you shouldn’t praise him that much. If the small child was constantly praised, what will we do if he stopped working well?”
<br/><br/>
His mouth may be modest, but his expression was full of pride.
<br/><br/>
It was the splitting image of a parent saying that their child still needs to improve in a lot of areas when the child had already gotten full marks on his test. From head to toe, their whole body leaked out a hypocritical aura.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s expression was serious: “I was only saying the truth.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin’s wrinkled face cannot help but smile to the point of becoming a flower: “You are really too polite.”
　　<br/><br/>
For the remaining half of the dinner, Grandfather Qin couldn’t stop smiling.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Even after eating more than normal, he can only feel comfort throughout his whole body.
<br/><br/>
Even after facing the incomparably irksome father and daughter pair, his mood was unaffected.
　　<br/><br/>
Compared with Su Zui’s uncles and the father and daughter pair, there was a distinct difference.
<br/><br/>
Each of their faces were pale and they were quiet as chicken. The aggressiveness from before all disappeared.
　　<br/><br/>
Watching his nephews’ faces from the corner of his eye, Grandfather Qin can’t help but feel disappointment in his heart.
　　<br/><br/>
As people get older, they worry more about family affection. In his years, he had lost his beloved daughter so he became especially tolerant to his close relatives.
<br/><br/>
While he was fully aware that these nephews had plans for the family company, but he didn’t excessively guard against them. Instead, he had done to the best of his abilities to support them when they started their own company.
<br/><br/>
The company that started overseas by the oldest nephew was set up under his support.
　　<br/><br/>
In these years, it can’t be said he devoted everything into helping them, but that didn’t mean he didn’t spend a lot of effort to these nephews.
<br/><br/>
Yet, how did each and every one of them repay him?
　　<br/><br/>
They partner up with an outsider who was better kept under the tables, and attack Su Zui without any regards in front of a precious guest.
<br/><br/>
If it weren’t for Su Zui’s strength and use his hard work to ruthlessly refute, then who knows how humiliated he could have been!
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin can’t help but feel bitter in his heart.
<br/><br/>
All these years, he had raised a group of white eye wolves in the end.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
At this moment, there was suddenly a piece of winter melon stained with droplets of soup appearing in the bowl in front of him.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s clear gaze looked over and he softly said: “You can’t be picky. You should eat more easily digestible food.”
　　<br/><br/>
The winter melon was boiled thoroughly and was saturated with the meat flavor soup. It was especially delicious.
<br/><br/>
Eating the food that usually doesn’t require the use of chopsticks, Grandfather Qin’s heart was warmed by the soup’s warmth.
　　<br/><br/>
Forget it. Since the family is ungrateful, he also doesn’t need to do arduous things.
<br/><br/>
He still have a proper grandson to raise.

After dinner, Grandfather Qin allowed Su Zui to accompany him together to send Fu Shijun off.
<br/><br/>
As a result, just when he finished talking, Su Chengzhi hurriedly said: “Zhimo, quickly go with your brother to send President Fu off!
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin: “......”
<br/><br/>
His face became cold and was unable to resist coldly saying: “Mr. Su should also quickly go back. In the future, you shouldn’t bring just anyone<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> out to meet people.”
　　<br/><br/>
Being an extremely self-restraint person, he rarely use this type of brute words to yell at others.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t because Su Chengzhi kept on challenging his bottom line, he was unlikely to criticize people like this in front of Fu Shijun’s face.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi’s face also became hard to look at: “Zhimo can also be regarded as your granddaughter——”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun suddenly opened his mouth. His magnetic low voice interrupted his words: “You should go back and rest. Just allowing Xiao Zui to sent me off is fine.”
　　<br/><br/>
His words were said to Grandfather Qin and Su Zui. He didn’t give a single glance towards Su Chengzhi or Su Zhimo and ignored them thoroughly.
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi didn’t think Fu Shijun would not give face like this. For a moment, he stared blankly and didn’t know how to continue talking.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s face didn’t reveal anything, but the hand hanging at the side of her body suddenly clenched up.
<br/><br/>
In her heart, she slowly let out a breath and exposed a cruel cold laughter.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Just wait. In just a little while, Su Zui won’t be able to appear in public any longer. Since he is at death’s door, just let him be proud a bit longer——
　　<br/><br/>
In the end, it was Su Zui’s oldest uncle who came out to mediate: “Haha. With President Fu being such a precious guest, we definitely need to all sent him off.”
<br/><br/>
A big group of people majestically came out and only stop after sending Fu Shijun out the door.
　　<br/><br/>
Just when Fu Shijun was about to open his car door and leave, he suddenly heard a horrible voice.
<br/><br/>
“Su Zui!”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “......”
<br/><br/>
The foot that had already stepped into the car retracted itself. Fu Shijun raised his head. As expected, he saw the man from the restaurant the previous time with a short middle aged woman at his side.
<br/><br/>
One was Yang Yuanhang. While he had never saw the other one before, but he had seen the photos from the materials. This was Yang Yuanhang’s mother.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s expression was tragic: “Su Zui, listen to my explanation! I really haven’t done anything with anyone else! From start to finish, I only have you!”
<br/><br/>
He said: “Before, you wanted to announce our relationship and I had always pushed it off. That was my fault. Now I had already brought my mom over and she already agreed to the stuff between us!”　　
<br/><br/>
Mother Yang’s expression was a bit rigid, but under Yang Yuanhang’s subtly hints, she still took a few steps forward.
<br/><br/>
She said: “I know you are a good…...good child. So long as you and Yuanhang can peacefully live together, I don’t care about my son being together with another man.”
　　<br/><br/>
The words from her mouth was open, but for some reason, it made people have a somewhat uncomfortable feeling.
<br/><br/>
Like allowing Su Zui and her son being together was an enormous charity.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
Looking at the mother and son pair who was speaking full of nonsense, Fu Shijun’s wrinkled his eyebrows and unconsciously turned his head to look at Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
Against his expectations, Su Zui’s face didn’t have a hint of panic.
<br/><br/>
So much that when he tilted his head and met Yang Yuanhang’s gaze, there was a moment of ridiculement. 
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing Yang Yuanhang suddenly appearing here, Su Zui was not surprised at all .
<br/><br/>
Ever since that day he sent Mother Yang to the villa, he hadn’t reply to any of Yang Yuanhang’s text or phone calls.
<br/><br/>
If Yang Yuanhang were to be content with his place, then it will be a strange phenomenon.
　　<br/><br/>
Being unable to shoot those photos, he decided to pull him along and forcefully get out of the closet in front of Grandfather Qin?
<br/><br/>
While this result doesn’t have the same provocation as that from the bed photos, but towards an elder, it was still a very serious attack and has a high possibility to develop problems from the anger.
　　<br/><br/>
Of course, that was under the condition that Su Zui didn’t give Grandfather Qin the Constitution Strengthening Reagent.
　　<br/><br/>
Without waiting for Su Zui to reply to Yang Yuanhang, several of his uncles turned pale from fight. Sentence after sentence chided at Su Zui.
　　<br/><br/>
“Xiao Zui. What being together not being together? What is your relationship with this man?”
<br/><br/>
“Don’t make trouble. You are still young. How can you learn all these messy stuff! To even fool around with men!”
<br/><br/>
“Before, uncle still felt that you were working hard. As a result, I didn’t think that you could unexpectedly do this type of thing. Isn’t this spitting on our Qin Family’s face?”
<br/><br/>
“That’s right. If the outside world knows that Qin Family’s successor would go so far as to sleep around with another man, how will they look at us?!”
　　<br/><br/>
Even Su Chengzhi suddenly became angry: “Su Zui, I originally thought you were rebellious, but I didn’t think you could go so far as to do these disgusting things. If you don’t repent, then I refuse to acknowledge you as my son in the future!”
　　<br/><br/>
Every one of them became more eager from these words. As if just by relying on the words of the mother and son pair, it was for certain that Su Zui had committed a humongous crime.
<br/><br/>
With every sentence said, Su Zui had seemingly already became the criminal of the family.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
While Grandfather Qin didn’t faint from anger, but his face was clearly unbearable to look at.
<br/><br/>
His body swayed and could not stand steady for a moment. His hoarse voice reprimanded: “That’s enough! Don’t say anymore. Making a disturbance at the entrance, who are you performing this for?! If you have things to say, say it when you get back!”
<br/><br/>
After he finished speaking, he looked heavily at Fu Shijun and his voice suddenly sounded older: “I’m sorry Shijun. It was rare for you to come, yet you have to see this mess.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun pursed his lips. He swallowed down the things he really wanted to say before saying: “It’s not a bother.” 
　　<br/><br/>
At the side, Su Zhimo saw this situation and her lips effortlessly turned up, exposing a mysterious smile.
<br/><br/>
She wants to see how Su Zui will still be able to clear his name under this type of circumstance.
<br/><br/>
This stepbrother of hers was mentally retarded to the max. Right now, he is most likely scared to the point of incapable of speech.
　　<br/><br/>
Her pleased mood was contained, but Fu Shijun was still able to acutely take note of it.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Out of the corner of his eye, he looked at Su Zui’s nominal stepsister and his wrinkled eyebrows became more tense.
　　<br/><br/>
Almost everyone was waiting to see Su Zui make a joke of himself, yet Su Zui didn’t show a frightened expression like they imagined.
<br/><br/>
Under everyone’s gaze, the delicate appearing youth raised his eyebrow and looked at Yang Yuanhang. His face didn’t have a hint of guilt or nervousness. With an almost pure look of bewilderment, he slowly opened his mouth: “Yang Yuanhang, are you misunderstanding something?”
　　<br/><br/>
He said: “I appreciate your painting talent so I subsidized you for a brief period of time. To my understanding, I had never done anything inappropriate to you. I don’t know how you were able to think up this type of…...misconception?”
<br/><br/>
In the quiet night, the youth’s clear voice was pleasant to the ears: “No offense, but if it is convenient, I suggest Mr. Yang to quickly make an appointment with a psychologist. If there is an illness, it needs to be treated as fast as possible.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo didn’t think that Su Zui would say such a big lie without blinking. The laughter on her face abruptly wiped clean and became rigid.
