								<br/><br/>
								Chi Yan watched the first passenger that sat 2 rows from him. The window reflected the passenger’s face--a completely unremarkable face that no one would remember after seeing it, a dull expression, a pair of eyes fixedly looking out the window.
								<br/><br/>
								Chi Yan immediately got goosebumps. He suddenly noticed something. That passenger wasn’t looking out the window. Instead the passenger was using the window reflection to watch him!
								<br/><br/>
								Chi Yan reflexively reached for his chest, but couldn’t feel anything there.
<br/><br/>
Ye Yingzhi’s bone ashes had long since been thrown away by him in panic. The spiritual jade had already lost most of its effectiveness. Mr. Tang was already dragged into his situation and nearly died. It sufficed to say that he didn’t have time to prepare any life-protecting items before Chi Yan left.
<br/><br/>
He really shouldn’t have overestimated his luck. With his constitution, encountering a ghost bus while running around outside in the dead of the night really wasn’t that surprising. Really, it was because no spirits or demons dared to come close while he was by Ye Yingzhi’s side for nearly whole year, that Chi Yan completely let his guard down. Not to mention all of his attention was on the big boss at home--naturally, he wouldn’t have any time to think about guarding against small fry.  
<br/><br/>
He unexpectedly got on a ghost bus. This kind of situation was difficult to escape from. Who would have thought that before seeing Ye Yingzhi, he would die here instead.
<br/><br/>
Besides fear, he felt a bit of regret.
<br/><br/>
Even if the ending is the same, he’d rather die by Ye Yingzhi’s hands.
<br/><br/>
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t keep my promise.” He silently murmured.
<br/><br/>
Chi Yan lifted the corners of his lips, his smile revealed a bit of bitterness.
<br/><br/>
At this moment, the bus stopped. The doors opened, and the night wind suddenly poured in, blowing away the sleep-inducing air.
<br/><br/>
Chi Yan looked up in surprise. But his hands were still held in tight fists, not daring to carelessly walk over--who knew whether they were on earth or in hell, if the newcomer was human or something else.
<br/><br/>
None of the “passengers” moved.
<br/><br/>
One person casually boarded the bus. He wore something similar to Chi Yan’s clothing, a white short-sleeve and black trousers, as if he were a normal office worker. But his hands were empty, and seemed completely carefree of the common tiredness of an employee. In addition, his appearance was outstanding and had an imposing manner, clearly not someone to be trifled with.

<br/><br/>As Chi Yan saw him, he unconsciously released his tightly held fists.

<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of the one who used to make him feel stressed, nervous, scared, and dread had Chi Yan breathe a sigh of relief. In short, this ghost bus and its strange spectacle was no longer worth being fearful over.

<br/><br/>In spite of everything, he subconsciously forgot that this was the strongest evil spirit he’s met his entire life.

<br/><br/>The word “Ye” was caught in his throat. Chi Yan watched with wide eyes as the man took each step towards himself. In the end, he even sat down on the seat next to him.

<br/><br/>He was just like the other “people” on the bus--shadowless.

<br/><br/>Chi Yan turned to face him and quietly asked: “Why are you here?”

<br/><br/>“You weren’t home even though it’s so late, so I came to pick you up. What if you were kidnapped?” Ye Yingzhi answered, like how a normal worried husband would.

<br/><br/>He continued: “You didn’t come back after so long. I thought you might have regretted it again. Who would’ve thought that you’d be foolish enough to get on the wrong bus.” He spoke as he watched Chi Yan with smiling eyes, chuckling. It was as if they were a pair of lovers, and those things that happened, never did.

<br/><br/>The way he smiled was especially charismatic. Even as a spirit, he was better looking than living people. Chi Yan saw his smile and couldn’t help but turn red.

<br/><br/>The bus kept moving forward without a single hitch, its incandescent light was still the same deathly pale, its passengers were still completely stiff, its windows was still a foggy scenery of pitch-black. However, he no longer noticed these details.

<br/><br/>He didn’t mind. Afterall, Ye Yingzhi was by his side.

<br/><br/>“Ye Yingzhi….” He opened his mouth, wanting to speak. However, Ye Yingzhi extended his right index finger and pressed it to his lips to stop him from continuing, his left hand helped pull him up.

<br/><br/>Chi Yan realized just now that right after he spoke, the bus had stopped without him noticing. The side door opened. None of the other passengers moved. Only Ye Yingzhi stood to lead him off the bus.

<br/><br/>Right outside was the small grove in the park that was 2 blocks away from his home.

<br/><br/>What a fascinating bus stop.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi continued to lead him deeper into the grove.

<br/><br/>“Ye...Ye Yingzhi,” Chi Yan finally squeezed out a sound, watching him cautiously. “....are you going to eat me?”

<br/><br/>He heard about legends of evil spirits eating people before. As for Ye Yingzhi, he doesn’t seem like the common spirits that try to look for substitutes. Since he was the one who took the bone ashes, he probably needed to pay his debt with all his flesh and bone.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi turned back to look at him with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

<br/><br/>Chi Yan thought it was a silent confirmation and hesitated a little before whispering a plea: “...Can you not eat me here but at home instead?”

<br/><br/>Even if he’s the one who wronged the other first, he still was still greedy and wanted to preserve a shred of dignity. He didn’t want to become a corpse in the wild.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi’s next step changed directions, leading him out: “Alright, eat at home.”

<br/><br/>Even though he originally wanted to take him to a stroll in the park.</p>

<br/><br/><center>————————</center>

<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">It was only after getting home and looking at his watch did he realize it was already 1 o’clock in the morning.

<br/><br/>After entering the house, Chi Yan kept glancing at Ye Yingzhi anxiously.

<br/><br/>He didn’t know how evil spirits ate people, where did they eat first, if they ate people alive or if they killed them first, or whether it would hurt.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi: “Go wash up. What are you standing in a daze for?”

<br/><br/>Chi Yan made a “Oh” sound before following orders to wash up.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi had him get on the bed. Chi Yan naively sat on the bed, absentmindedly patting the beige-colored bed sheets. If he were eaten in separate bites here, would the bed sheets get dirty? He really liked these bed sheets though.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi followed him in, too lazy to even speak this time. He directly tucked him into the sheets and turned off the bedroom lights.

<br/><br/>“Ye Yingzhi?” He called his name, completely no idea what to do next. His voice sounded especially warm in the quiet dead of the night.

<br/><br/>“Sleep. I won’t eat you today. It’s too late. Don’t you still have work tomorrow? Don’t worry, I won’t eat until tomorrow.”

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi saw Chi Yan’s sleepy face and couldn’t keep himself from laughing. When Chi Yan saw him before, clearly he had been deathly afraid. Now laying next to him, Chi Yan was still able to fall sleep so soundly.

<br/><br/>Completely unreserved, completely defenseless.

<br/><br/>The next day, Chi Yan was woken by the smell of breakfast just like usual.

<br/><br/>Ye Yingzhi raised his index finger and poked his forehead, leaving a trace of coldness: “Get up. It’s already 7:30. If you’re late to work, they’ll deduct your bonus right?”

<br/><br/>Chi Yan sat up immediately, unsure whether to be afraid of Ye Yingzhi or bonus deductions.

<br/><br/>Beside the bed was a newly washed and ironed set of new clothes. The clothes that he wore for several days straight at Tang Guangyuan’s place had already been put away.

<br/><br/>While eating breakfast, Ye Yingzhi only handed him his briefcase with his phone, wallet, car key, etc. inside.

<br/><br/>Chi Yan had never imagined that one day, the man called Third Young Master would actually become his own personal assistant. He rubbed his nose, hugged his bag, and watched Ye Yingzhi like a small animal while sitting in the chair.

<br/><br/>“After you get off from work, remember to buy ingredients. Buy more vegetable. Don’t just buy meat all the time.”

<br/><br/>“Oh.”

<br/><br/>“You need to be raised well for me to eat.”　　

<br/><br/>Even if Chi Yan was foolish or clueless, he was still able to understand that when Ye Yingzhi said “eat” he was only tricking him.

<br/><br/>But if he didn’t want his flesh or even his life, then he really didn’t know what Ye Yingzhi wanted to do.

<br/><br/>At this moment, Ye Yingzhi stood up and walked behind him, tying something around his neck. His fingers were a little cold, but it was like a normal person who was born with a lower core temperature. He wasn’t icy cold, but was rather within the acceptable range for a human body temperature.

<br/><br/>Chi Yan lowered his head and saw an extremely familiar small porcelain bottle.

<br/><br/>He knew that it contained Ye Yingzhi’s bone ashes.

<br/><br/>But this time, the owner personally gifted him with the ashes and even put it on for him.

<br/><br/>He felt Ye Yingzhi lean down and whisper by his ear: “This time, wear it well. You’re not allowed to take it off. And definitely not allowed to throw it.”

<br/><br/>Special thanks to 小鱼咕噜咕、三千花杀、毛巾被被、旧照片、爱吃沙拉的狮子、灯里姑娘 for their comments. Extreme colds are terrible, and no one can sleep during those QAQ. I’ve misunderstood the Evil-Suppressing Talisman. Cold medication doesn’t start working that quickly. Ladies, please take care!</p>
