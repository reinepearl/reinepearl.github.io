								Su Zui drove the car until he arrived at the Su family.
<br/><br/>
When he entered the villa, Su Chengzhi is currently talking to his wife and children in the living room. Sounds of laughter leaked from the opened doors.
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing movement, Su Chengzhi turned his head and saw his oldest son entering through the doors. His expression immediately became indifferent and in an extremely half-hearted tone, he said: “You came back.”
<br/><br/>
There wasn’t a trace of warmth from earlier.
　　<br/><br/>
After the original’s mother passed away, Su Chengzhi became lazy to cover up his indifferent attitude towards his son.
<br/><br/>
He doesn’t hit or scold, but his frequent silent treatment isn’t any better than hitting or scolding.
　　<br/><br/>
Growing up in this type of environment, the original slowly became gloomy and depressed, losing his ability to communicate with other people.
<br/><br/>
Loving a scum yet unable to extract himself from the situation like a normal person. Being a bit nice to a person but eventually devoting all of himself to them.
　　<br/><br/>
On the contrary, Su Zui’s stepmother’s, Xie Yan’s, attitude is very good. She stood up from the sofa and with a gentle smile and a caring mother attitude: “Xiao<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> Zui came back? Are you hungry, auntie<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a> can make something for you to eat.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan is very good at pretending. No matter what her thoughts are, as long as she is in front of Su Zui’s sight, her attitude towards her stepson will always be warm and soft, and treat him with the utmost care.
<br/><br/>
However, Su Zui was very disgusted by this stepmother, who only older than himself by a few dozen years. Don’t even talk about eating her food, just seeing her makes him feel disgusted. Everytime he could mock and ridicule her a few times before going upstairs without consulting anyone. 
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan is also used to this attitude. Although her mouth is polite, but her foot had absolutely no intentions of moving towards the kitchen.
<br/><br/>
Right now she is only standing there, waiting for Su Zui to mock her a few times. After he gets scolded by Su Chengzhi, the father and son will argue until they part on bad terms
　　<br/><br/>
However this time, Su Zui didn’t mock and ridicule her like before. Instead, he looks at her before saying in a gentle tone: “Ok, then go make some water bamboo chicken wings and abalone seafood soup.”
　　<br/><br/>
The whatsoever manner of speaking is similar to how one could order a housekeeper.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s smile on her face froze.
<br/><br/>
She only said a few perfunctory sentences. Saying them is enough but who knew that Su Zui could answer like this today?
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui slowly took off his jacket with his slender long fingers seeming like a piece of artwork under the light: “Don’t know how to make it? Then make two casual regular home cooked dish is also fine.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan forcefully smiled: “No that’s not……”
<br/><br/>
What is this, how did her stepson have a change in attitude today?
　　<br/><br/>
“Xiao Zui,” Su Chengzhi’s deep voice suddenly interrupted: “Your auntie is your elder, don’t be so insensible.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui put his jacket on top of his arms and showed an indifferent expression: “What are you saying? Auntie happily offered to cook me food. If I don’t answer, then I am insensible.” 
　　<br/><br/>
He looked at Xie Yan: “Or so to say…...auntie is only casually speaking and simply had no intentions of making the food?”
　　<br/><br/>
The youth’s deep black eyes were clean and penetrating. When he looked over, it was as if he came see a person’s deepest secret.
　　<br/><br/>
Without any reason, Xie Yan’s heart constricted: “How can that be? Auntie was only worried that the food I make won’t be to your liking……”
<br/><br/>
Although ever since Madam Qin died, Su Chengzhi had never cover up his indifferent attitude to his son. However, Su Zui is still surnamed Su. With Su Chengzhi’s attitude of causing grievances for the smallest things, it doesn’t necessarily meant that he is happy to see other people slap Su Zui’s face. 
　　<br/><br/>
She spent so many years just to obtain the Madam Su position. She could never let herself make a mistake on this type of stuff.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s eyes suddenly form into crescents, making his look extra soft and gentle: “How can that be? I heard that auntie used to specialize in housekeeping in rich people’s homes. You were very welcomed so you should definitely have been an expert in cooking.”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing this, Xie Yan’s hand on top of the sofa immediately tightened, with her fingernails slowly turned white due to the amount of strength used.
　　<br/><br/>
These words hit the her sore spot.
　　<br/><br/>
Her family background wasn’t good. She dropped out of high school but she was borned with an excessively pretty face.
<br/><br/>
She was unwilling to accept the fact that she will be stuck in the poor village for the rest of her life, so she did all she can to climb up the ladder. In the beginning, she worked at a Western-style restaurant. Afterwards, she was able to find work through connections to be a housekeeper in rich people’s homes, and continue to use extreme methods to connect herself with the higher ups.
　　<br/><br/>
Although this course of events was complicated, but she was finally able to succeed.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi’s face showed annoyance: “Family background doesn’t mean anything. Your father also worked from the bottom up. Right now, aren’t I friends with President Shen? Xiao Zui, quit being so peculiar and speak to your auntie properly.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......oh.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi sure has face<a href = "#footnote3bottom" id = "footnote3top">(3)</a> to say that.
　　<br/><br/>
Compare to the villa the original bought outside, the Su family villa is not the same. The Su family villa belongs to the most expensive district in A city. All who live in this district are real first-rated aristocratic families. They are very wealthy and respectable, not something you can obtain with just money.
<br/><br/>
The neighbors that you met when you casually take a walk outside either have a extremely deep history or on the top rankings of being rich and powerful.
　　<br/><br/>
Just by living here, not only does it represent that you are rich, but also high up on the social ladder.
<br/><br/>
This top level circle, if it wasn’t because he rode the coattails of the Qin family, then even if Su Chengzhi were to work in sweat and tears until his next life, he still could not have been able to squeeze into the circle.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at Su Chengzhi’s undisguised look of arrogance. His mood turned complicated and he ridiculed to the system: “I feel like Yang Yuanhang is the true son of Su Chengzhi.”
<br/><br/>
These two people are both hypocrites; truly no different from one another.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan forcefully laughed as she tries to smooth things over: “This is nothing. I will go make lunch now.”
　　<br/><br/>
Once she entered the kitchen, Xie Yan’s smile completely disappeared.
　　<br/><br/>
She stood near the sink for a long time.
<br/><br/>
Ice cold water flow down her carefully kept and increasingly exquisite hand, causing her to be unable to suppress a few shivers.
　　<br/><br/>
Ever since she married to Su Chengzhi, she haven’t done housework for who longs how long.
<br/><br/>
So long that it made her thought, she was a rich madam who had always live like a royalty. That the her, who had to climb up from the sewer, was all but a figment of one’s imagination. 
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
When it was time for lunch, Su Zui’s stepsister, Su Zhimo came back.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo is currently 20 years old, which is only younger than Su Zui by two years, and is still in college.
　　<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote4bottom" id = "footnote4top">(4)</a>Su Zhimo was obviously the child of Xie Yan and her previous boyfriend, but in reality, no one was stupid.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t his child by blood, with Su Chengzhi’s narrow mindedness, who even picks on his wife because her capabilities were stronger than his, how can he let an outside child be surnamed Su while also doting on this outside child?
<br/><br/>
Compare to Su Zhui, Su Zhimo is more like the family’s princess.
<br/><br/>
Once she arrived home, Su Chengzhi and Xie Yan’s mood improved at a speed apparent enough to the naked eyes and went to the door to welcome her.
　　<br/><br/>
The three people harmoniously talked at the entrance, making it all more apparent that Su Zui, who was sitting alone at the dinner table, is like an outsider.
<br/><br/>
If it the original was here, then the situation could definitely be awkward and sullen.
　　<br/><br/>
However, Su Zui’s inner thoughts not only unmoved, but he also still felt a bit hungry.
<br/><br/>
Seeing how the three people seems to have no intention of stopping for a while, he let the workers bring the dishes to the table and started eating alone.
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, Xie Yan’s cooking is actually not bad. 
<br/><br/>
Without the three piles of trash in front of his eyes, Su Zui’s appetite is great.
　　<br/><br/>
When the whole family finally finish their sentimental moment and came to eat, he is almost full.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing how he ate without them, Su Chengzhi’s face doesn’t look so good: “Where did you learn this from? How can you not have any manners? The elders haven’t even sat down yet but you are already eating!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui accepts the handkerchief that the servants passed to him. After slowly wiping his mouth, he said: “Not to your degree. Your wife had only passed away for two months but you already brought your mistress and illegitimate child into the family.”
　　<br/><br/>
When the original was ten years old, his mother died due to illness. When the burial ceremony was just finished, without waiting for the ashes to cool, Su Chengzhi turned his head and gave the original a young and pretty stepmom.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t out of worry that Su Zui was too small and that having no parents were a good thing, Qin family could have totally rip apart this white eye wolf<a href = "#footnote5bottom" id = "footnote5top">(5)</a>.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui spoke in an absent-minded tone, like how one casually comments on the weather.
<br/><br/>
Yet, the people who heard this were at a loss and was unable to do anything.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi’s face became completely red. His throat leaked out a coarse gasp. His eyes were filled with anger and even his hands started to tremble and began to lift up——
<br/><br/>
And very quickly fell down.  
　　<br/><br/>
Even if Su Zui’s personality is antisocial and isn’t close to the Qin family, but as long as this huge monster of a family exist, he doesn’t dare to move against this son.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan stood on one side. Even if she was told in the face that she was a mistress, she doesn’t dare to say a word. She can only bite her lips while her face turns white.
　　<br/><br/>
The dining hall slowly entered a dead silence, with only the sound of Su Chengzhi’s coarse breathing.
　　<br/><br/>
Finally, it was still Su Zhimo who opened her mouth and broke the heavy atmosphere; she walked to the side of the dining table, her expression clear like she wasn’t influenced by the atmosphere and Su Zui’s actions: “It’s rare to see older brother eating dinner at home.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t give her any face and slowly replied: “En.”
<br/><br/>
His sight stopped at Su Zhimo’s body for a few seconds.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo inherited half of her mom’s beauty. Her appearance lacked the vulgar air of being glamorous, and instead have more liveliness. 
<br/><br/>
It’s the type of beauty that no one can find fault in. Every part appears to be finely sculpted by an sculptor.
　　<br/><br/>
As a matter of fact, Su Zhimo is considered to be a goddess at school with enough admirers to circle around the playground.
　　<br/><br/>
Who could have thought that this type of pure and beautiful lady could hook up with her stepbrother’s boyfriend and plot to seize her stepbrother’s family business through wrecked trickery.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui sighed in his heart: “System, hurry and absorb some of the main lead’s aura. Maybe if you absorb enough you can upgrade.”
　　<br/><br/>
System 555: “......”
　　<br/><br/>
Cannon fodder system 555 is a book transmigration system. Since there is a book, there has to be a main lead.
　　<br/><br/>
The book that Su Zui transmigrated into this time relies heavily on the perspective of the female lead. The female lead isn’t any other person. Instead, it is the stepsister that turned him green.
　　<br/><br/>
Of course, this green isn’t a true green. After all, there are very few girls who can tolerate novels with this type of low level, lying, gay acting as the male lead.
　　<br/><br/>
In the novel, Yang Yuanhang is only a tool for the female lead to use. His appearance length isn’t longer than the appearance length of the original. Yet this insignificant tool was able to easily destroy the original’s life. 
　　<br/><br/>
After Yang Yuanhang and the female lead hooked up not too long ago, under the suggestions of the female lead, allowed the grandfather, who was the only person who doted on the original, to see a bed photo of the original and another homosexual together. This caused the grandfather to get a heart attack, enter the hospital, and passed away and reunite with his daughter.
　　<br/><br/>
The grandfather suddenly met a mishap, which caused the original to have no choice but to assume control over his mother’s company. 
<br/><br/>
His experience was insufficient and because his mood was unstable though the the death of a relative, the company quickly turned to a mess after people deliberately stick their hands in.
　　<br/><br/>
Even more terrible was that just at this time, Su Chengzhi finally knew about the relationship between his son and Yang Yuanhang. He originally did not like this son that his previous wife left behind. After knowing that he is together with a man, he became so angry to the point he criticize the original of being abnormal and disowned the original under the urging of his wife.
<br/><br/>
Not too long after, the original lost his mother’s company under the female lead’s plan and the big family property became that of the female lead.
　　<br/><br/>
Although it seems impressive, but it was only merely enough to be made into a wedding dress.
<br/><br/>
Of course, under what can be called the female lead’s extraordinary experience, this is only the beginning. 
<br/><br/>
Not only Su Zui, the entire Su family was only the stepping stone for the female lead.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui carefully looked at Su Zhimo and Su Chengzhi’s faces that shows no similarities at all. As if he thought of something funny, he let out a light laugh and his appearance turned soft and warm like a river.
　　<br/><br/>
“You guys can eat,” He said as he got ready to go up the stairs: “I’m going to take a rest.”
　　<br/><br/>
After he left, Su Chengzhi fling a cup down, causing a thunderous noise, and scolded loudly: “Unfilial son! Really fucking spoiled him too much!”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan stood on one side and used a soft voice to console him. 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo stood on another side and watched her lack of demeanor father and her apprehensive mother. An unobvious disgust flashed passed her eyes.
<br/><br/>
There are some people that even if their outside appearance are pretty and clean, their insides are full of filth that is impossible to get rid of.
　　<br/><br/>
She can’t acknowledge this stepfather and this Su family. If it wasn’t for the fact that that stepbrother has the right of inheritance to the Qin family, then as early as when she knew she wasn’t Su Chengzhi’s blood related daughter, she could unhesitantly leave the Su family.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
While the people at the bottom of the stairs are stuck with their own thoughts, Su Zui, the main culprit who is upstairs, carefreely took an afternoon nap.
　　<br/><br/>
This body’s constitution isn’t good. A few movement can cause the person to feel exhausted, which Su Zui isn’t use to.
<br/><br/>
The system market does contain a upgrade body constitution tool, but he can’t afford it. Only after completing a mission can he obtain experience points. Right now, Su Zui’s experience points are still zero.
<br/><br/>
He laid in bed while looking over the system’s announced missions.
　　<br/><br/>
[Main mission 1: Cannon fodder vengeance.]
<br/><br/>
[Mission summary: Change the original’s fate. Furthermore, make the scum male, who betrayed the original, obtain his deserved retribution.]
<br/><br/>
[Mission rewards: 5000 experience points.]
　　<br/><br/>
[Main mission 2: Inherit family business.]
<br/><br/>
[Mission summary: At least obtain either the father or mother’s company’s administrative power and stockholder.]
<br/><br/>
[Mission rewards: 5000 experience points.]
　　<br/><br/>
The latter had a good explanation, but the former’s explanation is a bit vague.
　　<br/><br/>
At what degree of punishment does it count as a “deserved retribution” for Yang Yuanhang?
　　<br/><br/>
Is it just let Yang Yuanhang become extremely remorse and that’s it? Or is it to the point where he becomes frustratedly poor to the point he fall from grace?
　　<br/><br/>
System 555 express that it is only an ignorant small system: “The criterias are decided by the main system.” 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui use his arms to get out of bed, squint his eyes, and yawned: “Then let’s give him the highest treatment.”
<br/><br/>
Since he can’t figure out the criterias, then he will directly settle the matter in one go <a href = "#footnote6bottom" id = "footnote6top">(6)</a>. After all, no mistakes can come from that.
　　<br/><br/>
Just like this, he used a few phrases to decide Yang Yuanhang’s ending.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui suddenly ask: “Is there any mission that isn’t related to the main lead? For example, replace the female lead and walk to the the top or such?”
　　<br/><br/>
System 555 hesitant for a second: “There are.”
<br/><br/>
System 555: “But because the main lead carries a luck halo. The mission to counterattack the main lead is very high. Even if it is released, the mission is still very hard to complete. That’s why under cannon fodder system, counterattacking the main lead mission is more like an Easter egg. If you complete it, you gain rewards. But if you didn’t complete it, nothing will happen.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “You guys are pretty humane.”
<br/><br/>
While he wash his face, he simultaneously look at the mirror and ponder.
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, Su Zhimo isn’t Su Chengzhi’s blood related daughter, but is instead a product of Xie Yan and another rich person’s one night stand.
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi is merely believes himself to be infallible while picking up another person’s dishes.
　　<br/><br/>
But this is still strange.
<br/><br/>
Obviously, just by using a paternity test one can uncover this lie. Unexpectedly, Su Chengzhi never doubted this daughter’s origins. With just one look, he believed firmly that Su Zhimo is his blood related daughter and was unable to stop himself from doting on her.
<br/><br/>
So much that even towards Xie Yan’s past, he did not look into it.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Xie Yan carefully covered up the fact that she relied on her body to climb up the social ladder, but her abilities still have a bottom line. If Su Chengzhi were to seriously investigate, then it isn’t hard to expose a few traces.
　　<br/><br/>
However, the usual selfish and astute Su Chengzhi seems to encounter a large brain hole in regards to this mother and daughter pair.
<br/><br/>
So much that until Su Zhimo finished using him and threw him away, Su Chengzi finally realized that he has been willingly wear a green hat for the past twenty years.
　　<br/><br/>
Is this what the system meant by the “luck halo” that belongs to the main lead?
<br/><br/>
He pondered for a while: “I feel that calling it mentally defective halo is more fitting.”
　　<br/><br/>
Forcefully pulling a person’s intelligence down to this inhumane level, if it wasn’t mentally defectiveness than what could it be?
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui packed up simply and just when he walked to the stairs, he was met with a pleased Su Chengzhi.
　　<br/><br/>
Because of the unhappiness during lunch time, Su Chengzhi’s face looks very horrible. A cold snort sounded from his nose.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhui took one look at the walking green hat and is too lazy to argue with him.
<br/><br/>
He fears that if he goes too near, his intelligence will also drop.
　　<br/><br/>
Who knew that Su Chengzhi could stir things up on his own: “Stand there. Where are you going now? All day long, you only know how to fool around outside. How long has it been since you graduated? How many times have you went over to the company? What? You feel that this arrangement isn’t up to your standards? Who didn’t start from the bottom up? If you don’t understand the situation of a basic worker, how can you manage them well? You always put yourself above others! You originally don’t have the same talent as you sister, but you aren’t willing to learn at all. With you like this, how can I feel relieved to entrust my painstakingly runned company to you?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui can’t help but ponder: “.......”
<br/><br/>
How much of this cheap dad’s intelligence was robbed by the female lead’s mentally defective halo?
　　<br/><br/>
“That small company of yours can be given to whoever. Quit putting on this play. I’m not going to cherish it.” Without giving any face, Su Zui’s face became cold, “Is your company’s worth as high as my mom’s company’s worth?”
　　<br/><br/>
“You——” Su Chengzhi’s face turned to the color of pig liver again.
　　<br/><br/>
Ever since he dated his former wife, he felt that his counterpart’s high family background and capability always poke at his sore spot.
<br/><br/>
He came from a rural area. His upbringings always says that it is the male who has power in the household.
　　<br/><br/>
He assiduously worked for half of his life to the point that his body became sick. After so much difficulty, he finally was able to cultivate a reputable company; but whenever anyone mentions it, it was always “President Qin’s husband”.
<br/><br/>
For so many years, he didn’t know how he was able to endure it.
<br/><br/>
Being hit in his sore spot, Su Chengzhi shed all pretenses: “Don’t feel so proud of yourself. No matter how big that company is, it is currently not in your hands. In the future, eighty percent of it won’t have any relations with you. Go conduct yourself more soberly Su Zui.” 
<br/><br/>
He coldy said: “Since you don’t cherish me as a father, then don’t bother coming to Fu family’s banquet tonight and let your sister go instead.”
　　<br/><br/>
Upper class banquets are an established way to make connections.
<br/><br/>
Fu family is a more rich and imposing family compare to that of Qin family. The banquet invitations are hard to get. He doesn’t know how much relationships and interests he used up in order to get an invitation letter.
　　<br/><br/>
The invitation only allows the guest to bring one companion.
<br/><br/>
If he brings Su Zui, then he has no way of bring his loveable daughter.
　　<br/><br/>
He was suppressed by his former wife for so many years and wasn’t even able to get close to this son who the former wife gave birth to. At the bottom of his heart, he doesn’t want to nurture Su Zui and help him establish connections.
<br/><br/>
Now that he removed all pretenses in front of Su Zui, he can just so happen to bring her along.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked down at him, with a cold expression on his face: “Oh, make way.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi step to the side. Although his face is still the same, but his mood is much better.
<br/><br/>
He thought happily: Su Zui in the end is still a child; doing things so impulsively and not thinking about the results. He doesn’t know what he’s losing out on.
　　<br/><br/>
Where could the Qin family willing to bring Su Zui along? How could he not know his own child?
　　<br/><br/>
A gloomy strange personality. Not only is Su Zui not close with his family, but also he is not close with the Qin family’s side.
<br/><br/>
Don’t know how to rely on a mountain when you can, this is what one can call inept and a fool!
　　<br/><br/>
If this type of people can succeed in life, he will write his name backwards!
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui can approximately guess what Su Chengzhi is thinking, but he feels that this person’s brain is beyond saving. There is nothing good to say.
<br/><br/>
He pushed open the villa’s door and saw a familiar figure in the garden.
　　<br/><br/>
It was Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
She doesn’t have any class in the afternoon. Currently, she is at the garden’s pavillion drinking tea and reading a book. Her hair is tied in a ponytail, seemingly more graceful than the ladies brought up from rich families.
<br/><br/>
Faint golden sunlight shines softly on her body, causing her to appear more tender and beautiful than the flowers in the garden.
　　<br/><br/>
Taking note of Su Zui’s gaze, Su Zhimo raised her head and gave him a light smile.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui also gave a fake smile in return. His smile caused him to expose his neat and tidy white teeths, like a small animal who just woke up and prepare to forage for food.
　　<br/><br/>
He exit the door, got on the car, and drove to a place the original haven’t went for a year.</p>
