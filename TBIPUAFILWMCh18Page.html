								Fu Shijing really wanted to cry.
<br/><br/>
Why was he always getting lectured by his father until he became a pig head yet refused to marry?
<br/><br/>
It was so he can play without bearing any burdens!
<br/><br/>
His heart had plans and that was to change girlfriend faster than one can change clothes. To say it in a good way, he was free and easy. To say it in a bad way, he was a slag man.
<br/><br/>
Whoever married him will only harm themselves.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Children wasn’t even a consideration. Even if he gave birth to one, he didn’t have the confidence that he can set a good example and educate the child well. He might as well not give birth to one.
<br/><br/>
Besides, his family’s emperor position was already inherited by his little brother. It wasn’t necessary for him to have a child.
<br/><br/>
In short, he lived pretty well as a single. He really didn’t want a wife or a child to add a level of restriction to himself!
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing originally still had a sliver of hope and thought that his little brother was intentionally scaring him.
<br/><br/>
But after seeing Fu Shijun’s indifferent face, his hope slowly shriveled up.
<br/><br/>
This little brother of his was never the type to like to tell jokes. If he says it’s one, it’s one. If he says it’s two, it’s two.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing felt like there was nothing left to live for: “Then......then who was that child?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun raised his eyebrow: “You want to recognize them and bring them back?”
<br/><br/>
Remembering the ambition leaking out from that email, Fu Shijing paused for a moment before shaking his head like a husky in the next second: “No no no! Can’t recognize! Can’t recognize!”
<br/><br/>
To actually dare to covet Fu Shijun’s position under Fu Shijun’s butt, this daughter of his can really dream!
<br/><br/>
Being such a salty fish, how did he manage to give birth to such an ambitious daughter?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing shaked his head: “Even then, I should still know who she is right......” Good or bad, it was still his seedling!
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face was solemn: “If you know, you will only hold me back.” 
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing: “......”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
These words were very reasonable. He actually had no way to refute.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun glanced at him: “Give me your personal account. Don’t worry, I won’t take her life. Our Fu Family will also give the appropriate child support money.”
<br/><br/>
The implication was that besides her life and child support money, don’t think about wanting anything else.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing didn’t dare to say anything. This was originally not a decision he can make.
<br/><br/>
If that daughter of his didn’t desire the Fu Family, Fu Shijun may give her some support because she was a relative.
<br/><br/>
But with her ambition being so big, then no matter what the circumstances are in the future, it will all be the consequences from her actions. 
<br/><br/>
He sighed and wiped his face. With a crestfallen expression, he said: “I will give it to you later. Whatever you decide is good. I’ll go to sleep first.”
<br/><br/>
Ai. It wasn’t that he doesn’t want to recognize that daughter, but it was just that children can really cause a lot of trouble. If he brought her back, it will only be a matter of time before she sentenced him.
<br/><br/>
To continue being a salty fish, he can only be a cold-hearted slag dad.
<br/><br/>
Was it his fault that humans are selfish?
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Even if it was a child he personally raised, if they did this type of stuff today, the decision he made will probably not change.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, this was a child who was only related to him by blood but he had never seen this illegitimate child’s face.
<br/><br/>
What was decided was already decided. But because it was his own child, Fu Shijing’s heart still felt uncomfortable.
<br/><br/>
He returned to his bedroom but he was unable to sleep after tossing and turning for half a night.
<br/><br/>
In the quiet night, his mind suddenly came up with a horrifying thought.
<br/><br/>
According to that email, his daughter was already in adulthood and had grown to be a slender and elegant woman.
<br/><br/>
It just so happened that this was his favorite taste: a twenty year old lady.
<br/><br/>
Well men. Even if they were about to be forty, they still like pretty ladies around their twenties.
<br/><br/>
Just like how women like young handsome men even when they are a bit older. It was understandable.
<br/><br/>
But spoiled vegetable was still spoiled. Without even meeting face to face, his daughter was already so big.
<br/><br/>
What if one day, he was really unlucky and had an affair with his own daughter?<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
In an instant, the plot of those dog blooded romantic fictional stories he had read rushed into his head.
<br/><br/>
Titles like “One Emotional Night: Illegitimate Daughter Will Rise” or “Overbearing Loves Daddy: Single and Spoiled Daughter Only Wants You” flashed through his mind like lanterns.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing almost cried from terror.
<br/><br/>
While he knows this possibility was very small, but what if? What if?
<br/><br/>
That night, Fu Shijing was unable to sleep and his eyes were kept open until dawn rose. 
<br/><br/>
Very quickly, the loose friends that Fu Shijing played with discovered that playboy Fu Shijing suddenly started coming around.
<br/><br/>
He no longer had any girlfriends and even when he meets up with those young ladies, he would follow the regulations and not touch a single finger of theirs.
<br/><br/>
Even when other people voluntarily come to fawn over him, he would still reject them with a seldom face and instruct them to have some self respect and self love.
<br/><br/>
The friends were completely bewildered and can only observe him like he was a fool.
<br/><br/>
“Hahahahaha what are you pretending to be?”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
“Did Mr. Fu scold you again? Even then, you don’t have to act like this. Don’t worry, this place is very private. Mr. Fu won’t know about it.”
<br/><br/>
“Are you, cough cough, sick somewhere? Do you need to go see the doctor?”
<br/><br/>
Faced with those questions, Fu Shijing didn’t say a single word.
<br/><br/>
He only resolutely pushed away the voluntary young lady. His eyes were full of the tiredness of an adult: “......You guys don’t understand.”
<br/><br/>
When he was still loose and carefree, how would he had known that there will be a day where he had to watch out for his own daughter when he was out to play?

Grandfather Fu actually didn’t have time to manage Fu Shijing. However, Fu Shijing’s encounters for this period of time have all been thoroughly written up and sent to fu Shijun. 
<br/><br/>
It wasn’t that he didn’t believe in Fu Shijing.
<br/><br/>
It was only that while Fu Shijing wasn’t a bad person, his IQ was indeed very limited. 
<br/><br/>
He was afraid that when Fu Shijing wasn’t careful, he will be deceived by Su Zhimo again.
<br/><br/>
As a result, it seemed that Su Zhimo was still cautious. After not receiving a reply form Fu Shijin<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->g, she didn’t make any movement.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, Fu Shijing’s conduct during this period of time made people not know whether to laugh or cry.
<br/><br/>
At the dinner table, Fu Shijun told Su Zui about this unexpected event: “My father had thought it was because his lectures finally had some effect and became so happy that he ate more than usual.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was amused to the point his eye shape became like moon crescents: “Then I hope Uncle Fu can stay like this for a while and let Grandfather Fu be happier for a few days.”
<br/><br/>
His smile was relaxed but his heart was actually astonished. Fu Shijing actually didn’t accept Su Zhimo’s invitation.
<br/><br/>
One has to know, in the original plot, Fu Shijing was actually successfully bewitched by Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun may be astute and cold, but he had a significant weakness. It was that he didn’t have much guard against his family members.
<br/><br/>
With Fu Shijing’s partnership, Su Zhimo was able to plant many important nails inside the Fu Corporation. These nails were unexpectedly useful in her and Fu Shijun’s last battle and directly decided the battle’s outcome.
<br/><br/>
It could be said that without Fu Shijing, the difficulty level for Su Zhimo to obtain the Fu Family undoubtedly went up by a few levels.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was originally debating whether he should remind Fu Shijun to pay attention to Fu Shijing or not.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
As a result, Fu Shijing didn’t accept Su Zhimo’s plan like the original plot and instead frankly told Fu Shijun about it.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui can’t help but be lost in thought.
<br/><br/>
This matter didn’t have any of his handling. It was all done voluntarily by Fu Shijing.
<br/><br/>
He suddenly recognize one matter.
<br/><br/>
Perhaps the main lead halo wasn’t unchanging.
<br/><br/>
Compared to when he had first arrived to this world, Su Zhimo’s mental defective halo had became less useful than before.
<br/><br/>
Perhaps it was because of the constant failure by the main lead that the plot constantly break away from its original orbit, and because of that, the luck belonging to the main lead will also decrease.
<br/><br/>
And it will decrease to the point that the person can no longer be called main lead.
<br/><br/>
“What’s wrong?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun saw him lost in thought and can’t help but ask.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
It was only then that Su Zui snapped out of it. He looked at Fu Shijun and smiled: “It’s nothing. I was just thinking about some company matters. There was suddenly a problem in one of the big projects. There are a few people on the board that are constantly giving pressure and giving people headaches.”
<br/><br/>
After reality proved to him that drifting away from the boss will only give the opposite effect, he no longer intentionally avoid Fu Shijin’s invitation.
<br/><br/>
Besides after thinking about it, maybe if he accommodate him a bit, Fu Shijun can gather up his courage to chase him a bit earlier and he can also reject him a bit earlier.
<br/><br/>
Yet it was regretful that Fu Shijun didn’t become more bold after his accommodation.
<br/><br/>
From start to finish, he stayed within the friend boundary and gave Su Zui continuous care and help. Even now, he didn’t exceed the boundary by a bit.
<br/><br/>
When Su Zui looked at Fu Shijun right now, it was as if he was looking at a turtle tightly keeping his claws within its shell.
<br/><br/>
Even if there was a piece of meat before its eyes and it was starving, it would still resolutely not reach out nor move.
<br/><br/>
This made him, the hunter who was holding a knife and ready to chop the turtle’s claws, felt extremely frustrated.
<br/><br/>
The turtle who withdraw its claws saw his frustrations and immediately offered his service: “The project with Dong Hui? My company and theirs had collaborated numerous times and I can consider myself to understand them. Why don’t you tell me about it?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui nodded and didn’t decline. He simply told him about the problem.
<br/><br/>
While he did have a natural talent and the system’s help, but his actual combat experience was still a bit<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> low. 
<br/><br/>
By listening to elder Fu Shijun’s advice, he can still benefit a lot from it.
<br/><br/>
As expected, Fu Shijun used a few words to point out the crucial point and also gave a few words on how to deal with the board members. All these were extremely useful experiences.
<br/><br/>
Seeing how this man looked especially gentle under the lights, Su Zui suddenly had a thought.
<br/><br/>
Actually, there was a very convenient way to make the boss give up his affection and that was to quickly find and date another person.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was definitely not a person that continues to tangle up with someone whose heart already had a person in mind.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui doesn’t like this type of method. Therefore, the idea was only formed before quickly forgotten.

One year later, Su Zhimo finally obtained the Su Company.
<br/><br/>
To obtain the manager position for the entire company in only one year after she graduated, it was already an acc<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->omplishment that made many people exclaim with admiration.
<br/><br/>
Her classmates and friends gave her unending praises for her current accomplishment.
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was originally also quite satisfied.
<br/><br/>
But every single time she was a bit proud, she cannot help but remember Su Zui becoming more and more prosperous as he stayed in the Qin Family.
<br/><br/>
While Su Zui had never returned to the Su Family for this entire year and seemed to have forgotten them, but that meager shadow had always stayed in Su Zhimo’s heart, as if it were an eternal unmoving mountain.
<br/><br/>
It constantly reminded her just how far away she was from the real upper class people.
<br/><br/>
Compared to the Qin Corporation, the Su Family’s small company can really make one lose face just by mentioning it!
<br/><br/>
He was clearly a waste that she had pushed down for ten years. But just by having powerful family from his mother’s side, he was able to live better than her by at least ten times. Why?!
<br/><br/>
Without knowing why, Su Zhimo always had a feeling that the Qin Family was originally supposed to belong to her instead of belonging to that waste Su Zui’s hands!
<br/><br/>
If Su Zui were to know her thoughts, he will definitely give her a thumbs up.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
In the original plot, Su Zhimo only took half a year before taking over the Su Company and then quickly used Yang Yuanhang to take the Qin Family away from Su Zui’s hands, before finally returning to the Fu Family with enormous assets and battled with Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
Even if she occasionally faced setbacks, she would still quickly achieve a bigger accomplishment due to the small setback.
<br/><br/>
Not like now where she was wasting so much time on the small Su Family.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zhimo didn’t know this. After a brief period of doubt, she continued with her plan.
<br/><br/>
Looking at that email from “Fu Shijing” in her mailbox, her face showed winning smile.
