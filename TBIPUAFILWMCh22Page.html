								“Apologies. I shouldn’t have gotten angry at you.”
<br/><br/>
After losing his self-control for a moment, Fu Shijun quickly adjusted his emotions.
<br/><br/>
He tried his best to be as calmly as possible to look at Fu Shijing and asked: “Is there something wrong?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing’s face was full of hesitation.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
While being suddenly swore at made him pretty dumbfounded, but he didn’t know why, when he received an apology from his demon king little brother, it made him more terrified.
<br/><br/>
He shook his head and said: “I saw your car stopped for quite a while upstairs so I came to ask.”
<br/><br/>
After hesitating for a second, he asked: “You, did you just come back from the hospital?”
<br/><br/>
Once Fu Shijing mentioned the main offender for Su Zui’s anger, Fu Shijun’s face dropped.
<br/><br/>
He said in a cold voice: “If you want to go, just go. No one is stopping you.”
<br/><br/>
Seeing how Fu Shijun’s expression wasn’t right, Fu Shijing hurriedly expressed his innocence: “No no no, I don’t want to go. I was in the wrong. When I knew that it was Su Zhimo that day, I only wanted to take a look so I followed the police. I don’t have any other idea.”
<br/><br/>
When he had known that he had a daughter, his heart had a tiny bit of anticipation.
<br/><br/>
When he thought it through, he understood: the other didn’t consider him as a dad.
<br/><br/>
She had clearly known of his existence, yet she hasn’t tried to find him once in the last twenty years.
<br/><br/>
It was only until she needed his identity as a member of the Fu Family that she suddenly contacted him.
<br/><br/>
Rather than considering him as a dad, it would be better to say she considered him as a tool.
<br/><br/>
He tried to explain himself in a few sentences: “I’m not that kind! The top of my head is still green!”
<br/><br/>
By raising his daughter for the last twenty years, the green hat on Su Chengzhi’s hat was firmly sealed.
<br/><br/>
But his biological daughter had called someone else dad for the past twenty years! His heart doesn’t feel any joy!
<br/><br/>
Even a man doesn’t want to be taking advantage of like this!
<br/><br/>
For good or bad, this was still a child with his flesh and blood. While he didn’t want it, it had already been born. Was he supposed to not raise it?
<br/><br/>
Why had she especially in a hurry to call someone else dad for more than ten years?
<br/><br/>
She really didn’t attach a single importance to him!<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
He humphed a few times: “I don’t have any opinions regarding this matter. What should be done should be done. If she had done bad things, she should assume responsibility! I’ll let the lawyer give her child support payment in a few days then I won’t care about this anymore.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun indifferently nodded his head. His face looked a bit better.
<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijing thought it through, he stopped having a guilty conscience when facing his little brother. So much that he was able to be concerned about Fu Shijun in his relaxed state: “What happened to you? Did they anger you? Why is your mood so bad?”
<br/><br/>
While Fu Shijun haven’t been affable to other people before, but for him to be irritated to this degree was still very rare.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun silently shook his head, seemly not wanting to discuss this topic.
<br/><br/>
Yet Fu Shijing was completely unaware, so much that he started pointing out his little brother’s expanding emotional state: “Then did you and Su Zui quarrel?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s just eased expression was wiped clean and became dark once more. It had became more terrifying than before.
<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
The atmosphere gradually became quiet.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s straight back slowly leaned back once again.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
With a heart full of tears, Fu Shijing gave himself a slap in the face. 
<br/><br/>
Fuck. When will this mouth of his finally do something good?
<br/><br/>
Under his little brother’s dead gaze, Fu Shijing braced himself and lightly coughed.
<br/><br/>
With a desire to live, he forcefully said: “I-I-I, while I’m not good at other aspects, but in terms of feelings, I still have a bit of experience!”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun silently looked at him for several seconds before giving a minute nod. He said with a gloomy expression: “Talk.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing hurriedly threw out his relation experiences: “It’s like this. Between partners, no matter what arguments happened, who is right or wrong is actually not important. The most important thing is attitude. Once a problem happens, you first need to apologize and then explain. You cannot by any means leave with a cold face without saying anything or forcefully pretend that nothing has happened! No matter what, you need to adopt the correct attitude. As long as you are sincere enough, most problems are redeemable.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun became silent: “............”
<br/><br/>
He remembered when the matter happened, he had forcefully turned the topic around and quickly left. His heart slowly dropped.
<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing also became silent.
<br/><br/>
He looked at his little brother’s cloudy face and cautiously asked: “Why don’t you go back right now and coax him?”
<br/><br/>
He strengthened his courage and advised: “Little brother, I know you want face, but you can’t care about face in regard<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->s to emotions. If you really care about the other, you can’t continue to be like this.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun didn’t say anything. He only pursed his lips into a straight line and the hand on the steering wheel gradually became tightened up. Because of the strength used, the blue veins at the back of his hands were so apparent it became a bit terrifying.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing trembled with fear as he looked at the pinched steering wheel in Fu Shijun’s hands. It was as if he was seeing his own neck being pinched.
<br/><br/>
After half a day, he saw the thin lips opened and heard a low voice said: “Thank you.”
<br/><br/>
Once Fu Shijun finished talking, he stepped on the gas and left the family entrance.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing watched the quickly depaturing shadow of his little brother and spew out a breath in worry.
<br/><br/>
Without knowing why, he always have an ominous feeling.
<br/><br/>
With that bad temper his little brother has, can he really coax someone?

When Su Zui received Fu Shijun’s call, he actually felt a bit unexpected.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
He originally thought that because of Fu Shijun’s turtle personality, he will be confused for three days and three nights before making a decision. 
<br/><br/>
As a result, he actually was able to think things through within a few hours?
<br/><br/>
The other side asked: “Are you free right now?”
<br/><br/>
The man’s voice was low and deep. Whether it was because he felt wronged or something else, the last few words were magnetic and rough, as if it had been grinded by sandpaper.
<br/><br/>
Even if it lost the quality through the cellphone, it was still like a feather. It scratched at the ears, making it numb and itchy.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui felt out of it and placed his cellphone a bit further away before asking: “I’m free. What’s wrong?”
<br/><br/>
The other side paused for a moment before trying to extend his claws: “......I’ll pick you up in a while and bring you to drink coffee, ok?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui cooperated by fishing out a shiny knife and laughed: “Ok. I’m fine with anything.”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
“Then——”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s sentence haven’t finished before the phone call suddenly transmitted a violent collision sound. After that, various type of messy noises penetrated into Su Zui’s ear drums.
<br/><br/>
It made it so that half of his ears vibrated until he couldn’t hear anything else. His brain only had the buzzing noises from his ears.
<br/><br/>
The change was too sudden. Su Zui pinched his cellphone. For a second, he felt as if he was thrown into a cold pool. His hands and feet were ice cold.
<br/><br/>
The next second, he used the sofa to help himself stand up. With hurried breathing, he yelled: “Hello? Hello?!”
<br/><br/>
He continued to ask the other side; his tone carried the anxiety he himself didn’t notice: “Fu Shijun, what happened at your side?! Answer me!”
<br/><br/>
