Once he heard Su Zui used a hissing voice to interrupt his confession, Fu Shijun’s whole body became rigid.
<br/><br/>
Although he had known early on that he would inevitably be rejected, but it was only when the moment really came that he discovered that he still didn’t have any way to accept it.
<br/><br/>
If, if he could have only endured a bit more——<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
　　<br/><br/>
His whole person were quickly filled with regret, so much that when he heard Su Zui said “Kiss me again”, he wasn’t able to respond for immediately.
<br/><br/>
It was only when Su Zui also said his following sentence that he suddenly returned to reality.
　　<br/><br/>
That hand, which was softly kneading the back of his neck, not only not made him calmed down, but instead it was like pouring oil onto fire, causing his heart, which was quickly beating due to their kiss, beat harder, as if it was about to jump out of his chest.
<br/><br/>
If he were to have a heart-related disease, then at this moment, even if someone were to immediately call for an ambulance, it probably couldn’t make it in time.
　　<br/><br/>
He lowered his head and looked at Su Zui, who he was grabbing by his arm.
<br/><br/>
The youth’s eyes were clean and clear. His black hair fittingly covered his eyebrows. His deep black eyes looked as if they were washed with water and was clear as glass pearls, and a reflection of him could be seen from them. When he lightly smiled, the dimples in his cheeks shallowly appeared, as if they were real wine and could intoxicate people<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun stared for a while and couldn’t resist his urge to nibble there, and could only control himself by using his lips to lightly touch those dimples.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
——He had long wanted to kiss here, but he never had the opportunity.
　　<br/><br/>
After kissing Su Zui’s dimples, he was afraid Su Zui will change his mind and regret it and immediately moved over and bit that beautifully colored lips.
<br/><br/>
He has heard and processed how Su Zui wanted him to do it lighter and so didn’t immediately gnawed. Instead, he first sucked on that pair of hot lips before slowly extended his tongue in.
<br/><br/>
Most probably because he was a naturally gifted student and was quickly able to learn without a teacher, compared to his first time where it almost made people want to call the police, the second time was at a manageable pace for a human.
<br/><br/>
Although he was still moving foolishly, but it was a miracle compared to before. 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t have any complaints towards this. His only experience was when he was nibbled like a vegetable by Fu Shijun. Even when it was odd, he was still able to accept it fairly well.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
So much so that he felt that this small student, whose kissing technique was like he was crossing a river, was still acceptable.
　　<br/><br/>
When Fu Shijun kissed for the second time, his spiritual ocean didn’t have any peticularities. Those brightly lit stars continued to quietly suspend itself in the sky and there wasn’t any new lights that appeared.
<br/><br/>
He thought he could feel disappointed, but in actuality, he didn’t.
　　<br/><br/>
The system notification sounded.
<br/><br/>
[Ding! Side mission 1: Be a winner in life (Attack male lead/female lead/boss). Completion status: 60%]
<br/><br/>
[Novice’s early reward system had already transferred 2000 experience points to your account; please make sure it has been received!]
<br/><br/>
[Shock! After a year, the small cannon fodder who has never set his heart on the target actually received the boss’s voluntary kiss! Could this be what they call fortune favors the fool?! No matter what, the boss had already courageously extend his big pig trotter<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a> and wanted to deepen his relationship with you! Please take notice and top him small cannon fodder! Quickly establish a you will always have me I will always have you pure romantic relationship with the boss!]
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
The system’s wording were as strange as before.
　　<br/><br/>
His recall of the side mission only remained in his brain for a second before his attention was distracted by the strange feeling on his waist.
　　<br/><br/>
The hand that was grabbing his arm a moment ago had groped down to this waist at an unknown time. It pushed aside his cold and rigid suit jacket, untucked his shirt from his belt, and forcibly pushed its big palms in.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s palm was very warm. Pressed against his body, it was as if it was a lit stove.
　　<br/><br/>
Because of Fu Shijun’s touch, Su Zui felt many goosebumps appearing and curled back in reflex.
<br/><br/>
......He originally was a person who was very aware of his personal space. It was only after he set down a very big resolution that he was able to kiss someone else like this.
<br/><br/>
Especially since Fu Shijun was the type of person who has a very strong aura. When he was sucking on the tip of his tongue, it gave him the feeling that he was being held by the back of his neck.　　
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s frame was slender, but this didn’t mean he didn’t have any muscles. When Fu Shijun inserted his hand in, he could clearly feel the light layer of muscles around Su Zui’s waist. The taunt muscles was an especially nice feeling for his hands, making him unwilling to let go and made him want to continue wandering down from Su Zui’s waist.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui was clearly on guard and had curled his waist in an attempt to slip away from his hand. He immediatel<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->y embraced Su Zui and walked a few steps forward to press Su Zui against the bathroom walls. It was only like this that he could prevent Su Zui from really running away.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui struggled a couple times before stopping. He didn’t make any demands. Instead, he only moved his brain a bit and panted as he said: “......You arm, don’t bump it.”
<br/><br/>
If they were to go to the hospital, then the matter will blow up.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nibbled his chin. When he leaned towards Su Zui’s ears to talk, it was like a subwoofer. The voice was deep enough to scare people: “It doesn’t matter. You don’t need to worry about it.”
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui stopped gasping for a while, his breath was immediately stolen by someone.
<br/><br/>
After the kiss finished, his brain became a bit lightheaded and dizzy. Without knowing why, he extended his arms to embrace the man nibbling him.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s back muscles were very beautiful. It wasn’t any worse than professional bodybuilders. When he tensed his muscles, they were very tight. Su Zui kneaded the top of it and felt as if he was kneading on a piece of hard rock.
<br/><br/>
In a very messy confusion, he thought just when will his body become like this? 
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Most probably because they celebrated too early, but as the two kept embracing one another, they unknowingly bumped into something and opened the shower head switch.
<br/><br/>
“Hua la” and a stream of cold water fell upon their heads and immediately cooled down the two’s heated movement.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui immediately opened his eyes in bewilderment: “Your arm!”
<br/><br/>
He used his quickest speed to turn off the shower head switch but it was already too late. The position that Fu Shijun was standing was directly under the shower head. It only needed one second before he was drenched from head to toe.
　　<br/><br/>
In the end, the two still had to run to the hospital with their tails between their legs and deal with Fu Shijun’s drenched injury.
<br/><br/>
Throughout the whole process, Su Zui’s face was stretched taut. It was only after the examination and was sure that Fu Shijun’s injury was still healing well and didn’t obtain any infections that he let out a sigh of relief.
　　<br/><br/>
The doctor once again disinfect the wound and instructed: “Although nothing happened this time, but you only removed your stitches recently. If it’s possible to not come in contact with water for a week, then it’s better to not come in contact with water.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lowered his eyes and looked at the hideous looking injury on his arm and suddenly asked: “Will this wound leave a <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->scar?”
　　<br/><br/>
The doctor replied: “This injury is a bit deep. It’s impossible to not leave any scar. But with the specialized scar removal surgery now, you can make the scar fainter. You don’t need to worry too much.”
<br/><br/>
Make the scar fainter still meant the scar won’t fully disappear.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nodded. His expressionless face didn’t allow anyone to know what he was thinking: “En.”
　　<br/><br/>
After exiting the hospital, Su Zui asked him: “You are worried about leaving a scar?”
<br/><br/>
The system market has many beauty products that can remove scars. If Fu Shijun really minded, he could buy one.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun raised his head to look at him. After staring for half a minute, he said in a low voice: “It doesn’t look good after taking off clothe<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->s.”
<br/><br/>
If someone were to tell him two years ago that he will worry about being disliked by the person he liked and didn’t want to leave a scar in the future, he will definitely feel as if that person has a problem in their brain and will make him roll as far as there is
　　<br/><br/>
“......” Su Zui was inexplicably able to read Fu Shijun’s real thoughts from that pair of deep black eyes and helplessly said: “Don’t worry, there won’t be a scar.”
<br/><br/>
Forget it, if he wants it, he’ll buy it. Isn’t it only a beauty product? It doesn’t cost much.
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
When the two left the company for the hospital, they were completely in a rush and wasn’t able to cover it up. As a result, when Fu Shijun entered the hospital again, the news quickly entered Grandfather Fu’s ears.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu immediately became worried. Once Fu Shijun arrived home, he first asked whether anything happened to his arm before asking what had happened.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Towards both of these questions, Fu Shijun was silent for a long while: “............”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu thought that something serious happened in the inside circle and the wrinkles between his eyebrows became more apparent.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s black eyes became dark and kept silent about the important parts while telling the important ones: “An assistant did something wrong. When she cried, she bumped into a cup of water.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu immediately became angry: “How could they be so careless? How did this assistant get recruited!”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun said: “She’s already transferred away.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu nodded his head: “Transferring her away is correct. With this type of accomplishment, they can’t continue to do work by your side!”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun said in a deep stable voice: “I’ll first head upstairs.”
　　<br/><br/>
After his son left, Grandfather Fu was still angry for half a day before suddenly realized that something wasn’t right.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
The assistant bumping into a cup of water meant that she bumped into a cup of water. But when his son spoke, why did his ears turned red?
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>

At the same time, Xu Yanyan still didn’t know she had already substituted her boss and bear a huge black pot and was currently crying to a middle aged man in complaint. Her tears were like pear blossoms falling from the rain. She looked weak and pitiful.
<br/><br/>
“Uncle, I don’t want to be at the reception desk anymore. I, I don’t want to continue wiring customer calls!”
　　<br/><br/>
The Human Resource Director, who had opened a back door for his niece originally, gritted his teeth: “You are really capable. Do you know how many people were staring at the position to be the CEO’s assistant? Do you know how much effort I wasted to put you in? And you repay me by doing stuff like this?”
　　<br/><br/>
Although Xu Yanyan’s position was the lowest of the assistants, but because it can frequently give people the chance to come in contact with the CEO, the competition for it was actually very fierce.
<br/><br/>
At that time, he thought that this distant niece looked beautiful enough and wanted to benefit from the intimacy of an influential person in case it could really happen, and wasted effort to arrange her into that spot.
<br/><br/>
In any case, that position didn’t require any specialized skills. Anyone could do the job. As long as Xu Yanyan put in some effort, she could do her job well.
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, he didn’t think this niece was really so capable and failed in doing such simple work and was told to personally get out by the President Fu!
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Without experiencing any benefits, the pipe dream had already drowned!
<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan felt very distressed from his scolding, but still said in a wronged voice: “Uncle, I beg you, help me. Help me plead. I really don’t want to continue doing a job with no future.”
<br/><br/>
The Human Resource Director coldly laughed: “Speak for you my ass! When you go to do work at the reception desk, it’s still a small matter. If President Fu was to bring down his anger on my head, I’ll also fall into misfortune! Just you wait. If I was to be implicated by you, you can immediately get out and go home! You don’t even need to think about being at the reception desk!” 
　　<br/><br/>
And still wanting him to plead for her! Did she think that just because she cries, the whole world will revolve around her? Why doesn't she grab a mirror and see how she look like!
<br/><br/>
