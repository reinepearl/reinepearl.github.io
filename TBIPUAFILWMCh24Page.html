								But he had already arrived. He needed to put on a thick face and pretend to be a light bulb, or else there he won’t be able to report back.
<br/><br/>
Lightly coughing a couple times, Fu Shijing tried to knock the door naturally.
　　<br/><br/>
The two people, who were engrossed in work, raised their heads to look at him. They don’t look alike, but their eyes were like the abyss, making Fu Shijing’s whole body feel uneasiness as he stared at them.
<br/><br/>
It was as if an alpaca entered into a group of wolves. It always felt like he entered into the wrong territory.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui politely stood up and greeted him: “Hello Second Uncle.”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing Su Zui calling him uncle, Fu Shijing almost got choked by his own saliva. Because his desire to live was strong, he frantically rejected: “No no no. You don’t need to call me that.”
<br/><br/>
Or else it will be really awkward when he changed his title to Second Brother<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>!
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
“Call, call me——”
<br/><br/>
Calling him Second Brother right now isn’t right. He doesn’t know how intimate they are right now. If he rashly pierced through this paper window open, he might ruin something.
<br/><br/>
He thought about if for half a day but was unable to think of a safer title, causing him to forcibly turned the topic to something else and awkwardly ending that subject: “Haha. It is a small matter. Let’s not talk about it anymore.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui smiled but didn’t say anything.
<br/><br/>
He understood Fu Shijing’s silent desire.
<br/><br/>
The relationship between him and Fu Shijun isn’t that type of relationship. However, he doesn’t need to explain to Fu Shijing about this.
　　<br/><br/>
Because Fu Shijing and the female lead had originally colluded together in the original plot and defeated Fu Shijun, his impression of this person was only so-so.
<br/><br/>
As a result, it was only after he come in contact with Fu Shijing that he found out that while this person may be a bit stupid, he didn’t really have any bad intentions.
<br/><br/>
He really doesn't know how Fu Shijing would move just because the female lead say move in the original plot and dig all those pit holes for his whole family.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lightly uttered: “Is there something you need?”
<br/><br/>
It was only then that Fu Shijing remembered his original purpose. He hurriedly lifted the ther<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->mo food container in his hand and said: “Look. Father especially let Auntie<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a> stewed turtle soup for you to give you more supplement.”
　　<br/><br/>
With a serene face, Fu Shijun said: “I already ate.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing felt really wronged. It wasn’t as if he intentionally came late: “I got out to the house three hours ago, but got stuck in traffic at the West District for two hours. Even if I want to go to the restroom, I——”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun continued talking as if he was minding his own business: “I also ate dessert after the meal. Xiao Zui cut an apple for me.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing was dumbfounded for a second. After a moment, he carefully said: “......Congratulations?”
　　<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was about to suffocate from the awkwardness that arose from the two brother’s dialogue.
<br/><br/>
So much that he doubted whether Fu Shijun’s IQ assimilated some of Fu Shijing’s IQ.
　　<br/><br/>
He stepped forward and took the food container from Fu Shijing’s hand: “I’ll put it in the refrigerator first. He can drink it warmed up at night.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lived in a VIP hospital room. It had a refrigerator and a small kitchen. It was very convenient to do anything.
　　<br/><br/>
How could Fu Shijing dare to have any objection? He felt that when he arrived, he was like an outsider: “Oh. Oh okay. Your decision is good.”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
He said: “I’ll sit here for a while before leaving. You guys can continue to work. You don’t need to worry about me.”
　　<br/><br/>
While he knows he was a very irksome presence, Fu Shijing still put on a thick face and stayed behind.
<br/><br/>
Or else if that old man knew that he didn’t even stayed in his little brother’s hospital room for ten minutes, he will definitely get a big scolding regarding how heartless he was when he gets home.
　　<br/><br/>
He looked around and found a place with a sharp corner. He moved his small stool over and single-mindedly read his novel in an effort to drop his presence as much as he can.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui and Fu Shijun continued to deal with work without any intention of guarding against him.
<br/><br/>
It was most likely because they knew it wasn’t necessary since he......really doesn’t understand a single thing.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing: “......”
<br/><br/>
This type of suffering from discrimination from everywhere at anytime really gives him an indescribable feeling.
　　<br/><br/>
He sourly closed his novel. He started up his game and turned the discontent from his heart to the killing motivation in his game.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
As a result, under the game’s impassioned sound effects, he continuously lost ten times.
<br/><br/>
It was extraordinarily happy.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
That bowl of turtle soup became Fu Shijun’s dinner as planned.
<br/><br/>
Except, that bowl of soup had an ingredient added secretly by Su Zui.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui put the bowl of soup in front of Su Zui and in a seemingly considerate manner, he said: “Wherever there is injury, you need to supplement that injury. Your arm is injured so you should eat a few turtle claws.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “Ok.”
<br/><br/>
Because he was blinded by love, he was simply unable to discover that Su Zui was using every opportunity he has to diss him as a turtle. 
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nodded his head and started drinking.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s pair of eyes shone as he watched Fu Shijun drank the soup.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun originally didn’t like the taste of turtle soup, but whenever he stopped, Su Zui would coax him to drink a couple more mouthfuls.
<br/><br/>
He was unable to reject Su Zui’s request and can only put on a thick face and finish drinking the rest of the soup.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Even the turtle shell in the soup was gnawed clean.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui saw that the bowl didn’t have a single drop of soup left and nodded his head in satisfaction: “As long as you rest well, your arm will definitely heal well.”
<br/><br/>
He had added a bottle of Constitution Strengthening Reagent into that bowl of soup. If Fu Shijun didn’t recover well, he will file a complaint against the system market!
<br/><br/>
The results of the initial version of the Constitution Strengthening Reagent can’t be considered a defiance of natural order, but for Fu Shijun’s small wound, this was already enough.
<br/><br/>
The doctor said that Fu Shijun’s injury wasn’t serious, but the probability of lingering effects was still very big. 
<br/><br/>
After recovery, the injury wouldn’t influence everyday life, however, Fu Shijun couldn’t do any heavy lifting.
　　<br/><br/>
Originally, Fu Shijun’s body was especially good and had specialized in wrestling. To suddenly have an arm crippled was really too bad.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t even hesitate before buying a bottle of the reagent for the boss from his own pocket.
<br/><br/>
——The experience points he gained from attacking Fu Shijun will definitely be returned because the attack will fail in the end. So this time, he really means it when he is paying out of his pocket.
　　<br/><br/>
He’ll consider this as repaying Fu Shijun for all the help he had done for him.
<br/><br/>
Besides, completing the two main mission will give him a total of 10000 experience points in the end.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> He can still afford to pay for the 600 experience points reagent.　　
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun only thought that Su Zui was comforting him and didn’t pay it much attention: “Ok. It will definitely get better.”
<br/><br/>
As he spoke, he stealthily tightened his abdomen.
<br/><br/>
That bowl of turtle soup was really too much. After he finished drinking, he felt a pressure in his stomach.
　　<br/><br/>
It can’t continue like this, Fu Shijun solemnly thought.
<br/><br/>
Laying down for so long, his eight block abdomen will definitely soften! When he gets out of the hospital, he needs to quickly train and regain it!
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
The days passed in the hospital for the two of them can be considered relaxed, but Su Zhimo’s days were not steady at all.
<br/><br/>
She had originally thought that even if she was impetuous for a moment and had bought someone early on to smash into Fu Shijun, she wouldn’t fall to this degree.
　　<br/><br/>
She had buried her trails very early on and she could confirm that it was very stable. Even if the police we<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->re to tear apart the entire A city, they still couldn’t find a single bit of evidence to prove it has any relations with her.
<br/><br/>
She had originally left this flag to guard against any mishaps.
　　<br/><br/>
Since the Fu Family had forced her to this state, she could only use this in advance.
<br/><br/>
Since they aren’t willing to let her go, then it would be better for everyone enter hell together.
　　<br/><br/>
To be hit by that truck, even if Fu Shijun didn’t die, he will still be ruined! Maybe he will even be unable to take care of himself for the second half of his life!
<br/><br/>
As for her, she will be cut ten years, but after she gets out of jail, she is still in her thirties; she is still healthy and have time to make a comeback.
　　<br/><br/>
At that time, her hand and feet will still be robust. On the other hand, Fu Shijun’s limbs aren’t robust at all. How can he battle against her?
　　<br/><br/>
As Su Zhimo continued to imagine, her mood unexpectedly became cheerful to the point that she was still able to comfort Xie Yan: “Mom, you don’t need to worry. Life has its ups and downs. A setback for a period of time doesn’t mean anything.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s expression was wan and sallow. Her eyes were swollen due to her crying: “Mama only has you left. Zhimo, you definitely need to work hard. Mama can wait.”
<br/><br/>
After knowing Su Zhimo wasn’t his own biological daughter, Su Chengzhi argued with her for divorce.
<br/><br/>
While the judge hasn’t made his decision yet, but the results can already be anticipated.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
She was the person who first lied and Su Chengzhi also have connections in court. The final decision regarding the splitting of assets will definitely not be a huge amount for her. It may even have her leave marriage without any possession or property.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Su Chengzhi had transferred the Su Company’s share to his daughter, but with the Su Company presently in its borderline bankrupt state, to keep holding on to that company will only hold people back.
　　<br/><br/>
Although she has some savings in her hands, but she had already lived the rich madam life in the Su Family for more than ten years. That little bit of savings was not enough to support her luxurious lifestyle.
<br/><br/>
She had already been spoiled by that generous lifestyle! It was really hard to consider living a month while only spending a few thousand yuan! How could she live like that!
　　<br/><br/>
Fallen to this degree, she actually feels some resentment towards Su Zhimo. Resenting her for her carelessness and making everything into a big mess!
<br/><br/>
But she didn’t dare say anything.
<br/><br/>
For her whole life, she has been living like a silk flower<a href = "#footnote3bottom" id = "footnote3top">(3)</a>. Su Chengzhi has already abandoned her. Fu Shijing wasn’t even willing to give her a single glance. The only person she can rely on right now is her biological daughter Su Zhimo.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing her mother’s miserable expression, Su Zhimo’s expression flashed. She went to Xie Yan’s ear and whispered: “......I still have a few ten millions hidden. I had already told the lawyer to sent it to you later. You can use this money to help me get out. Then we will definitely be able to do something.”
<br/><br/>
Once Xie Yan heard this, her eyes can’t help but shine.
　　<br/><br/>
The mother and daughter pair haven’t finished talking yet when the door was pushed open by someone.
<br/><br/>
It was the two police officers: “The doctor said that your body condition is well enough to leave the ho<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->spital. Please come with us to the police station.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s eyes flashed with gloominess, but she was still calm.
<br/><br/>
The court has already declared her guilty. She couldn’t stay in the hospital for a lifetime.
<br/><br/>
“Ok.”
　　<br/><br/>
Just when the police officers were about to take her away, they suddenly received a call.
<br/><br/>
When they hang up, the police officers look at Su Zhimo and coldly announced: “Ms. Su, there is currently new evidence found. As you are the Su Company’s legal representative, please cooperate with us on the findings of Su Company’s involvement in a huge tax evasion.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s complexion greatly changed.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph4">
Not only Su Zhimo, but a few of Su Company’s high executives were also brought to the police station for an investigation.
<br/><br/>
The police’s action was high-profile. The police siren was blasting off in front of the big Su Company building and took away a few of Su Company’s big shareholders.
<br/><br/>
Within an hour, the whole business world knew about this matter.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
When the originally troubled Su Company received this attack, the people in the inner circle became more frantic.
<br/><br/>
The high executives, who were luckily not taken away by the police, all became very scared and even dreamed of police knocking on their door.
<br/><br/>
The employees were also not in a mood to work. They don’t even need the paycheck from this month! All of them hurriedly pack up and left, afraid that they will be dragged into a big rotten mess!
<br/><br/>
Within three days, the entire Su Company already had a few floors empty. It was completely different from the lively scene from half a month ago.
　　<br/><br/>
A day after, a portion of the people who were brought for investigation were all released, but a bigger portion were apprehended for arrest and had to be left behind in the police station and wait for the court’s final decision.
　　<br/><br/>
Being the Su Company’s current legal representative and the person in power, an additional crime charge was added to Su Zhimo’s head.
<br/><br/>
Besides of being suspected for leaking Fu Corporation’s business secrets, Su Company’s tax evasion, and illegal financing......with these five to six crimes, if Su Zhimo still get her thirty years in jail in the end, she was already getting off light.
<br/><br/>
Thirty years. Just how much thirty years does one have in a lifetime?
　　<br/><br/>
Thirty years later when she leaves prison, she will already be a haggard looking middle age woman. What can she do then?
<br/><br/>
The best of her youth will be buried in that ice cold prison.
　　<br/><br/>
Up until now, Su Zhimo was thoroughly anxious. Once the interrogation period passed, she immediately let<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> her lawyer contact Xie Yan and have her bring the money to mediate through the situation. No matter what, she needs to first pay the tax payments and fines. This way, in the final sentence, she could still get a few years deducted from her sentence.
<br/><br/>
But really quickly, the lawyer told her with a distressed expression that ever since the money was transferred to Xie Yan, Xie Yan had never contacted him ever again and had only left two million behind for her.
　　<br/><br/>
Two million......to the eyes of common people, this may not be a small amount. But to Su Zhimo, who needed to pay a huge amount of tax payments, this is no different than using a cup of water to save a burning cart.
　　<br/><br/>
How could Xie Yan have the heart to do this? How could she have the heart to do this?!
<br/><br/>
For so many years, if it wasn’t for her enduring her disgust, pretending to be a caring daughter to Su Chengzhi, and use various kinds of methods to create a barrier between Su Chengzhi and his biological son, how could Xie Yan easily consolidate Su Chengzhi’s favor?
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan didn’t need to do anything and can be the rich madam that she had always wanted.
<br/><br/>
But her? She had to cautiously and conscientiously grow up. The path didn’t have a single easy step!
　　<br/><br/>
She had gave her mother so much. While she hasn't received as much back as she hoped, but she had never thought that when they were met with a mishap, her mother would be so unwilling to consider her at all.
　　<br/><br/>
As Su Zhimo continued to think, her tears can’t help but numbly run down.
<br/><br/>
She had lived more than twenty years. In order to get into a higher position, she had been vicious and merciless to many people. It was only to her biological mother that she had been a bit genuine.
　　<br/><br/>
When she was small, Xie Yan had hugged her numerous times and lightly said: “Zhimo, you need to work hard in the future. To live with Zhimo in a very big house in the future, mama isn’t afraid of suffering more hardships.”
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
She had formerly thought that no matter the circumstance, her mother will always accompany and help her.
<br/><br/>
But in reality, at the most crucial point, that warm temper woman had selfishly took the money that could save her and unhesitantly ran away.
　　<br/><br/>
She had formerly thought that there will be one day where she will bring her mother to enter that “very big house” and live a superior life.
<br/><br/>
Yet now, because she had violated the law and was about to put behind the bars, her mother, who had formerly said that she will bring her to live in a big house, had ruthlessly left.
<br/><br/>
She suddenly remembered something. As if she was seeking for some comfort, she eagerly asked the lawyer: “Do you know about Fu Shijun’s condition? How is he? Is he dead or handicapped?”
<br/><br/>
She was constantly in the hospital under the police’s surveillance and had trouble getting information from the outside. It was only now that she knew that Fu Shijun had entered the hospital, but she was unable to hear further details.
　　<br/><br/>
The lawyer was startled for a moment before saying: “I, I know. He is doing well. Nothing major happened. He only hurt his arm. I heard he recovered extraordinarily quick and is about to leave the hospital.”
　　<br/><br/>
Bang.
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s final support pillar in her mind slowly collapse.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
