								His small friend should be working right now.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun expressionlessly stared at his cellphone, as if he had a deep grudge against it.
<br/><br/>
Slowly waiting yet receiving no reply, he could only move his gaze away and looked at the encrypted emails on his computer, his eyebrows becoming more wrinkled as he read.
　　<br/><br/>
These were Yang Yuanhang’s information. 
<br/><br/>
Ever since that day at the restaurant where he participated in the strange emotional dispute, he could always unintentionally remember that scene. In the end, he simply ordered people to investigate a bit.
<br/><br/>
As a result, some of the materials found can give people a headache.
　　<br/><br/>
That person called Yang Yuanhang. On one side, he was together with Su Zui and relied on him for money. On the other side, he had been ambiguous with multiple people.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s eyebrows became more furrowed and his fingers tapped on the table a few times, making a clear clunking noise.
<br/><br/>
Suddenly, he received a new email from the same address: “Sir, we have discovered new information……”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face became darker as he looked over the new information.
　　<br/><br/>
Starting from Yang Yuanhang bring a person home, Mother Yang catching the couple in the act, to Su Zui arriving and then leaving.
<br/><br/>
Everything that happened yesterday were all laid out on the screen.
　　<br/><br/>
After reading, his face was frightening enough to look at, as if the next second, he would have smashed the computer.
<br/><br/>
He sent his assistant two files.
<br/><br/>
“Send these two files to…...Don’t expose your identity.”
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
System 555: “Host, your personal email received a new email.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui initially didn’t think it was important: “Who sent it?”
<br/><br/>
System 555: “Fu Shijun’s assistant.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “Oh…...en??”
<br/><br/>
System 555: “The sender hide their IP address.”
<br/><br/>
However, it didn’t have any use.
<br/><br/>
Even if one uses the highest IP concealing method, the system can still decode it.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was a bit interested: “Let me see.”
<br/><br/>
What is with the boss today, sending both text and email, being so cordial towards him? 
　　<br/><br/>
After glancing at the email, Su Zui’s face became strange.
<br/><br/>
He really didn’t think Fu Shijun could send him a reminder of all things.
　　<br/><br/>
The information shows, half an hour ago when the other asked if his work was going smoothly or not, he was even looking at gossip all alone.
<br/><br/>
It somehow seems a bit pitiful.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui, in a rare occasion, felt a bit guilty.
<br/><br/>
He looked at his cellphone: “......Why does he care for me to this degree?”
　　<br/><br/>
Wasting energy just to gather up information and also anonymously sending it to him, it was practically the model of a selfless citizen.
<br/><br/>
He and Fu Shijun only met face to face two times. He honestly can’t understand where the other’s goodwill was coming from.
　　<br/><br/>
System 555 tried to find the answer: “Maybe it’s because the boss is a good person?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui became amused by it giving Fu Shijun a good person card: “How can you be so cute?”
<br/><br/>
System 555 was suddenly teased and crashed without warning: “......”
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui finished casually teasing the system, his fingers stopped on his cellphone screen for a long time, before slowly starting to type.
<br/><br/>
Forget it. He will only lose out not hugging a willing big thigh.
<br/><br/>
Besides, he wasn’t the type to waste an opportunity.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: [Not smoothly QAQ]
<br/><br/>
The final expression was inputted from automatic association. Su Zui’s fingers slipped and the message was sent out.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui had just thought of retracting it when he saw that the other side had already entered the “currently typing” mode.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui shivered once: “......”
<br/><br/>
He looked at that cute crying expression, and felt that his image under Fu Shijun’s eyes was probably advancing to a strange distorted direction.
　　<br/><br/>
The annoying spirit next door: [Don’t cry. Where is it not going smoothly?]
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” He wants to kill this typing method!
<br/><br/>
But explaining this expression would be very strange. Su Zui simply pretended that nothing happened.
<br/><br/>
He took the first step to selling miserable: “The proposal I spent a week on didn’t get an approval. Need to redo.]
　　<br/><br/>
The annoying spirit next door: [For which field?]
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: [New media. It’s for the promotion of a new merchandise.]
　　<br/><br/>
The annoying spirit next door: [I can consider myself familiar with this area. If you don’t mind, can you talk about which aspect? I can help you find some resources.]
<br/><br/>
Most collaborations have their own secret clauses. If one were to expose it, they would be held responsible; so he didn’t mention about seeing the specific details.
<br/><br/>
While he didn’t need to be so thoughtful towards Su Zui’s project, but what should be avoided should still be avoided.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui directly send the proposal over: [This was the protocol that was sent back. Can uncle help me take a look?]
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was shaken by this huge trust and can only reply after half a minute: [You can’t casually send other people the proposal in the future. If it was discovered, it will cause problems.]
<br/><br/>
This time he will let it pass. He can help Su Zui take responsibility.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui expression didn’t change: [I trust uncle.]
<br/><br/>
His heart was steady.
<br/><br/>
To have the first party’s boss look over the proposal, does it count as leaking information?
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun didn’t reply, as if he was absorbed in looking over the proposal.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked pensive: “He’s really looking over it.”
<br/><br/>
He was only half believing half not believing when he was probing him. He didn’t think Fu Shijun was this cooperative.
<br/><br/>
Letting this workaholic boss look over this small project. He can’t help but admit this feeling was pretty cool.
　　<br/><br/>
After twenty minutes, the other side finally responded: [It was wonderfully done.]
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun looked at the practically beautiful proposal and raised an eyebrow.
<br/><br/>
Initially, he didn’t have much hope for Su Zui’s proposal.
　　<br/><br/>
Even if it was him. When he first started learning from experience, he would commit many mistakes.
<br/><br/>
Don’t even talk about Su Zui who didn’t receive much training compared to that of other families.
　　<br/><br/>
But the proposal was very unexpected. Even if it was him looking over it, he can say a phrase of “not bad”.
<br/><br/>
Except for some small careless mistakes, there weren’t anything to criticize.
　　<br/><br/>
He couldn’t help but ask: [Which company are you doing the collaboration with?]
<br/><br/>
There was still a sentence that was heavily implied but wasn’t send out: With such lack of foresight, it will probably go bankrupt soon.
　　<br/><br/>
The other side quickly send over a sentence.
<br/><br/>
Small friend: [Uncle’s company.]
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: ? ? ?
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
After receiving the affirmation that Su Zui’s project was already send back, Su Zhimo can’t resist exposinging a bright smile.
<br/><br/>
Sure enough, the previous defeat was only a mishap.
<br/><br/>
So long as she is earnest, things will still go as smoothly like before.
　　<br/><br/>
She continued to give another number a text.
<br/><br/>
“The time is here. If we don’t act now, we may not have an opportunity in the future.”
　　<br/><br/>
……
　　<br/><br/>
“Your oldest uncle came back from abroad so his vision is broad. You can be in contact with him more.”
<br/><br/>
Sitting in the car, Grandfather Qin held Su Zui’s hands as he continued to urge.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui obediently nodded his head: “Grandfather, I will.”
<br/><br/>
The uncle that Grandfather Qin was talking about was Grandfather Qin’s little brother’s eldest son. He had started a company overseas and had recently came back.
<br/><br/>
Today, he came back to A city so they were about to give him a welcoming dinner.
　　<br/><br/>
When Su Zui and Grandfather Qin arrived at the restaurant, the welcoming dinner’s main lead had already waited for a long time.
<br/><br/>
Not only this person, almost all his uncles were assembled. The seven to eight people caused the private room to become lively.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin’s blood was weak, but his brother’s side was the complete opposite.
<br/><br/>
He had a series of five children, enough to assemble a male army<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>.
　　<br/><br/>
In those days when the main branch only had a daughter, it wasn’t that these uncles never had the inclination to replace her.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui’s mother was too bright. Her innate skills weren’t any worse than her cousins. Grandfather Qin was also unyielding, and stubbornly gave the corporation to his daughter.
　　<br/><br/>
These uncles had know their place for only a few years, before becoming restless again once Su Zui’s mother passed away.
<br/><br/>
As Grandfather Qin defend the company while waiting on his successor currently, he had in fact received an unimaginable amount of pressure from his own family.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui supported Grandfather Qin as he sat down and was extremely courteous when he greeted the elders in the private room: “Hello uncles.”
<br/><br/>
These uncles looked extremely friendly toward Su Zui: “Don’t be so polite! Everyone here is family! Little nephew doesn’t have to be so reserved!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui bashfully smiled but didn’t say anything.
<br/><br/>
It could be said they were blood related relatives, but in terms of benefits, they weren’t actually any different from a predator.
<br/><br/>
If they would find an opportunity to drive him out of the Qin family, these uncles of his wouldn’t hesitate.
<br/><br/>
After they finish questioning about Grandfather Qin’s health, the uncle who had returned from overseas looked at Su Zui and carelessly brought up: “I heard that Xiao Zui has already entered the company to work. How is it? Are you used to it yet?”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin knew his grandson didn’t have any experience and was afraid he couldn’t do so well the first time, and immediately tried to give Su Zui a way out: “What are you used to it or not. Even if he isn’t used to it, he still needs to get used to it.”
<br/><br/>
The uncle smiled while giving Grandfather Qin a chopstick of vegetables: “What uncle said is correct. That being said, as your uncle, I don’t really have much to give to Su Zui and can only advise a few things regarding work.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t have a chance to reply before there was knocking on the private room’s door.
<br/><br/>
The people who entered were two men wearing suits. One was tall and elegant, while the other had some weight on the body, with a slightly oily face.
　　<br/><br/>
The tall elegant person seems to recognize Grandfather Qin: “I heard that your family was eating here so I took the liberty to pay a visit.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin pulled on Su Zui’s hand and gave him an introduction: “This is your Uncle Fu’s most capable subordinate. You can call him Uncle Zhao or Director Zhao.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui obediently called out: “Uncle Zhao.”
<br/><br/>
Director Zhao: “You flatter me. You flatter me.”
　　<br/><br/>
The three lively exchanged greetings. The leftover oily man should be someone without any importance as Director Zhao didn’t have any hint of introducing him.
<br/><br/>
They were cheerfully talking when the oily man suddenly called to Su Zui: “Manager Su!”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his eyebrow. He didn’t remember ever meeting this oily person.
　　<br/><br/>
The oily man gave himself a self-introduction: “Manager Su, my name is Xu Lihong. You may not have met me, but I’m the person in charge of the collaboration you have with Fu Corporation this time.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s face shown a bit of surprise and said: “Is that so? This must be fate. To even meet just by eating dinner.” 
　　<br/><br/>
But in his heart, he laughed.
<br/><br/>
Fate yeah right. If they really meet by coincidence, then there ghosts must exist.
　　<br/><br/>
After Director Zhao and Grandfather Qin finished exchanging greetings, Director Zhao prepared to leave: “Then we won’t be bothering you——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s uncle opened his mouth to interrupt his goodbye: “Director Zhao doesn’t need to be in such a hurry to leave. Since Manager Xu is working with Xiao Zui on the collaboration and just happen to be here, why don’t we ask him how Su Zui’s working situation is like? Being elders, we can’t help but be concerned.”
　　<br/><br/>
“Right right. Manager Xu, please tell us?”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing this, Xu Lihong’s face showed just the right amount of awkwardness, and after resisting for half a day, he vaguely said: “All in all, Manager Su is still young……”
<br/><br/>
His sentence was vague, but it didn’t prevent people from understanding.
<br/><br/>
“While this proposal were not up to expectations, but if he were given more time, Manager Su will definitely do better.”
　　<br/><br/>
Every one of Su Zui’s uncles looked regretful.
<br/><br/>
“Aiya, that is really too bad. It seems that my nephew is still too young.”
<br/><br/>
“Uncle is really too rushed. Bring Xiao Zu into the company this early. Look, isn’t it already causing problems?
<br/><br/>
“You can’t say it like that. The small child is still young. He still needs to trouble Manager Xu for help.”
　　<br/><br/>
The uncles and Xu Lihong were mutually modest, but in reality, they were echoing one another and spared no effort to dragged down Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
The private room’s atmosphere immediately became heavy, as if it can drown people.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t seem to experience this atmosphere at all, his face didn’t contain a hint of astonishment.
<br/><br/>
He was still indifferent like before. His face carried a somewhat smiling expression, as if he wasn’t affected by the words everyone was saying.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin looked at the obviously here to cause trouble Xu Lihong, looked at his obedient grandson, and was unable to resist sighing in his heart.
<br/><br/>
He originally still had some hope, thinking that since Su Zui had been working so hard lately, maybe the results would be really good.
<br/><br/>
But at this point, even if he wasn’t willing, he still has to accept the reality that the Su Zui right now was still lacking too much experience.
<br/><br/>
Just when he was about to open his mouth to divert the topic and save Su Zui some face, he heard Director Zhao say with astonishment: “What do you mean it wasn’t good? Didn’t that proposal pass through?”
<br/><br/>
Xu Lihong blanked for a second: “What? How come I didn’t know? I have full power in the collaboration with Manager Su. Director Zhao, did you remember wrong?”
　　<br/><br/>
Director Zhao stated with confidence: “I didn’t. This was ordered personally by President Fu. He said the proposal was especially outstanding and told me to pay close attention to it.”
<br/><br/>
Xu Lihong was bewildered. From the start, he didn't pass the proposal, how could it reach the boss?
　　<br/><br/>
Could it be, could it be…...Su Zui send it over through personal connection?
<br/><br/>
That should be right. The Qin family and Fu family were old friends. If Su Zui wanted President Fu’s contact information, it shouldn’t be hard.
　　<br/><br/>
Why didn’t he think of this back then?!
<br/><br/>
Xu Lihong’s cold sweat rolled down from his forehead one by one.
　　<br/><br/>
His big boss even complimented this proposal after looking it over, yet was told it wasn’t worthy by this small subordinate.
<br/><br/>
This foolhardy action of slapping the boss’s face, how was it any different from not wanting his life?
<br/><br/>
If he had known this earlier, no matter how much money he was given, he couldn’t dare say a single word against Su Zui’s proposal!
　　<br/><br/>
Just thinking how he inadvertently bragged to his boss about his misconducts, Xu Lihong can only feel his thighs shaking, almost to the point where they are unable to stand.
　　<br/><br/>
As soon as Director Zhao spoke, the whole private room suddenly became silent.
<br/><br/>
The awkward atmosphere gradually extended.
<br/><br/>
The uncles who were frantically pressuring Su Zui just a second ago were suddenly confronted with this miraculous unforeseen event. Being caught unprepared, they didn’t know how to continue.
　　<br/><br/>
Who could have thought, just when they were making hidden sarcastic comments to imply how Su Zui should not interfere with company matters; at a speed faster than a thunderbolt, the sarcasm was directed back to themselves, ruthlessly ridiculing them. 
　　<br/><br/>
In the private room, except for Su Zui, Grandfather Qin, and Director Zhao, every single expression was extremely marvelous.
　　<br/><br/>
Especially Xu Lihong, his face had become paper white with a horrified, like he was going to faint the next second.
　　<br/><br/>
Director Zhao seemed to dislike the fact he hasn't attacked enough and once again turned his head towards him and said: “Oh, that’s right. I forgot to let you know. President Fu felt that this proposal being used on your small project was too much of a waste, and decided to use it on a bigger project. This time, I will be personally overseeing it. In the future, this doesn’t involve you.”
<br/><br/>
