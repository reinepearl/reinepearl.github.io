The moment Xie Yan came back from abroad, she was locked in by Su Chengzhi for two days. Without a single drop of water, she was tormented to her last breath.
<br/><br/>
When she fainted in the closet, she thought about a lot of stuff.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Two days later when Su Chengzhi let her out, she had already lost her rebellious attitude. In front of Su Chengzhi’s cold sarcastic comments, she could only show a humiliated expression without talking back.
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Chengzhi finished swearing, he slanted his mouth and gave her a smile. The smile was very eccentric: “What? Not going to report to the police? Xie Yan, let me tell you. If you are going to pretend, you better pretend longer for me and not let me discover anything wrong.” 
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, Xie Yan can’t really accept his ugly and fat face. She pressed against her stomach, which had already lost its perception due to hunger, and pressed down the urge to retch and cry as she lowered her head.
<br/><br/>
She was actually a bit of a face con. If it wasn’t for Su Chengzhi’s good face, she couldn’t have set her eyes on him back then.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The oily look Su Chengzhi has became now really makes her head feel numb the moment she has a look.
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, the words of departure that she had hardened her heart to prepare still had an opportunity to be said out loud, but......she didn’t decide to.
<br/><br/>
Besides Su Chengzhi, there was no one willing to give her money.
<br/><br/>
The money that she took from her daughter had already been cheated away. Rig<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->ht now, there was less than ten thousand yuan on her. Where could she go?
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi had extracted himself from the Su Company early on and wasn’t implicated too much. His fines were also not big. After selling the mansion and sport cars, there was still money left in his hands.
<br/><br/>
Although it can’t compare to before, but this was already Xie Yan’s sole driftwood that she can grab onto.
　　<br/><br/>
For her whole life, she had relied on other people to live. Now, she had long lost her ability to live on her own.
　　<br/><br/>
The days that Xie Yan lived with Su Chengzhi weren’t joyful. Su Chengzhi remembered his grudge regarding her lies. Everyday, he would hit and swear at her and completely didn’t regard her as human. For who knows how many nights, she could silently cry about her misfortune in the dark and thirsted for someone to save her from this fire pit.
　　<br/><br/>
But what was regretful was that no one cared about her bitter experience.
<br/><br/>
Just like after the Su Company’s bankrupt, the business circle in A city unsympathetically forgot about this small family business.
<br/><br/>
Without the Su Family, the world continues to turn like before.
<br/><br/><center>————————</center><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Several months later, a business family from A city held a banquet as a welcome for the return of their only son from abroad. In the invitation list, there were several well-known figures from the business world.
<br/><br/>
A city was originally one of the economic centers domestically. The famous leaders that were randomly selected were all from wealthy people on top of the ranking chart.
<br/><br/>
The standard for this private banquet cannot said to be not high.
　　<br/><br/>
Being an insignificant welcome reception, it naturally didn’t fit with the grand atmosphere.
<br/><br/>
The most important reason was that this business family will announce the marriage between their son and another family’s daughter in their son’s welcome reception.
<br/><br/>
This family’s daughter’s background was also very important. If this marriage was to be a success, then it will bind the two family’s corporation together. When that time comes, just how powerful the effect will be was unpredictable.
　　<br/><br/>
There were countless number of eyes that have their attention on this banquet.
　　<br/><br/>
“......Son and Lady Zhao’s wedding will be held mid next year. At that time, we hope that many guests will also participate in the ceremony.”
　　<br/><br/>
Just as the host finished speaking, all the guests had already begun clapping<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->. The atmosphere was especially enthusiastic.
<br/><br/>
There were a continuous flow of guests who came up to speak good words to them.
　　<br/><br/>
“Wenzhuo and Wanqi is really an ideal couple as if they were destined to be together. Just by holding hands and standing there, it really gives people a pleasant feeling.”
<br/><br/>
“Wenzhuo had just returned but he is already settling down. Really don’t know how many girl’s hearts he had hurt. Haha. When Wenzhuo had just went abroad, I heard that many daughters wanted to follow him abroad.”
<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo coiled his arm around his composed and beautiful fiancee. With a humor fitting for this situation, he responded to the guests’ enthusiasm: “Auntie is really over flattering me. If it is just like you said, you are shaming me.”
<br/><br/>
He continued to make fun of the situation: “If you continue talking, Wanqi might get angry at me.”
<br/><br/>
The female his arm is coiled around fittingly give a shy laugh, making her appear lovable and cute.
　　<br/><br/>
With a generous family background, beautiful academic grades, and a beauty by his side and with him also looking handsome and elegant, it is reasonable to say that Li Wenzhuo was simply the standard of the standard of a winner in life model, remarkably like “other family’s child.”<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
But at this moment, this winner in life was only smiling on the outside even when he was looking at his fiancee.
　　<br/><br/>
He did not feel disgust towards this marriage. He only felt it was dull.
<br/><br/>
Although his family looked as glorious as before, but in reality, there had been many setbacks and dangers that had been buried for the past few years. If they wanted to walk away from this perilous situation, they needed a powerful ally. The Zhao Family was a hard to come by choice. 
<br/><br/>
That’s why, he had no way of refusing this marriage.
<br/><br/>
The only fortunate thing was he didn’t have anyone he liked. No matter who he married, to him, this marriage wasn’t too difficult.
　　<br/><br/>
As for that day when he will suddenly like someone......Li Wenzhuo’s eyes darken and didn’t continue with the thought.
<br/><br/>
They, who were born with this family background, had no power over their marriage.
<br/><br/>
If they wanted to profit, then they needed to pay the price. In this world, t<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->here was no such thing as obtaining something without payment.
<br/><br/>
Everybody doesn’t have the freedom to act as they wanted. He actually didn’t have anything to remorse over.
　　<br/><br/>
Just when he was slightly distracted, his father’s voice brought him back to reality: “This is President Fu and President Qin. These two are both youthful and talented domestically. Wenzhuo, don’t just stare. Quickly give them a greeting.”
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo followed the direction of the sound and saw two men standing side by side.
<br/><br/>
One had a very tall and big stature. His aura is cold and grave. With a somewhat deep look in his eyes, it gives him an unapproachable feeling. His features were extremely magnificent. His shoulders were wide and his legs were long. One could see sturdy and powerful body under his black suit.
<br/><br/>
With only a look, it made people incapable of ignoring him. 
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo’s eyes shined: “Hello President Fu. I had often heard about you ab<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->road.”
<br/><br/>
The business done by the Fu Family was very good. When he was abroad, he had often heard about President Fu’s brilliance and fame.
<br/><br/>
Now that he is seeing the real person, although he was pressurized and felt faintly depressed, he still mostly felt admiration.
　　<br/><br/>
The higher the starting point, the harder it is for the successor to gain achievements. For them, to be able to guard the business their ancestors left behind is already very difficult. Yet, Fu Shijun hasn’t been in his seat for ten years and hard already expanded the Fu Corporation by fifty percent of its original size. It simply made people gasp from amazement.
<br/><br/>
When he was abroad, he had always put this President Fu as his goal.
<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo showed a rare sincere smile and shook Fu Shijun’s hand. His gaze turned to the slightly shorter youth at the side.
<br/><br/>
This person and Fu Shijun were two completely different body types. His body was slender and his appearance was soft and obedient, like one’s next door neighbor’s little brother. He does have a straight and tall aura, but he lacked too much offensive aura.
　　<br/><br/>
He had also heard of Su Zui’s name.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The change in power in the Qin Family wasn’t a small matter. Although his family hasn’t had many collaborations with the Qin Family, but it was enough to understand the importance of the matter.
　　<br/><br/>
This successor had only been in position for a few months. Currently no one knows how powerful Su Zui is so he also doesn’t have any evaluations.
<br/><br/>
But seeing how much he looks like an obedient child, to be able to preserve his ancestor’s work is already not bad.
　　<br/><br/>
At this time, Li Wenzhuo, who set down his assessment, still don’t understand a principle: the more harmless a person looks, the higher chance they won’t blink when they dig a pit for someone else.
<br/><br/>
It was only in the future when he lost again and again to Su Zui in business competitions that he finally realized just how blind he was when he made his assessment.
　　<br/><br/>
Although his evaluation towards Su Zui was only average, Li Wenzhuo’s expression didn’t reveal anything. He smiled and said: “President Su is really young and smart. Youths have a promising future.”
　　<br/><br/>
“You are too polite.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui lightly smiled and pretended as if he hadn’t see Li Wenzhuo’s suddenly<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> plastic smile. His gaze stopped on this male host for a few seconds.
<br/><br/>
That’s right. This person with what can be said as the “textbook version of winner in life” position was Su Zhimo’s partner in the original book.
　　<br/><br/>
Male lead Li Wenzhuo had the male lead’s mark of illustrious family background and handsome appearance. Ever since high school, he had been studying abroad. It was only after Su Zhimo stabilized her position in the Qin Corporation that he came back from abroad due to the business marriage with the Zhao Family.
<br/><br/>
At the engagement party, his unmoving heart for many years started to ripple due to the brilliant Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
On one side, he had to stabilize his family’s business. On the other side, he had his own love. The male lead was stuck between and suffered very much.
　　<br/><br/>
According to the route in the story, this moment was the start of the “you love me, I love you but because of duty, we can’t be together” dog blooded oppressive love story.
<br/><br/>
But because the original story belonged to the strong female and refreshing g<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->enre, its selling point is that the female lead was vicious and merciless the whole way and mary su to the point it reached the sky. Oppressive love story dropped that fortune route too much so it can’t exist.
　　<br/><br/>
That’s why without the oppressive love plot even starting, Su Zhimo had already used some underhanded methods to deal a huge damage to the Zhao Corporation that the male lead had a business marriage to.
<br/><br/>
As the Zhao Corporation’s value dropped, the marriage naturally became “possible, but not necessary.”
<br/><br/>
At this moment, Su Zhimo brought the Qin Corporation to the male lead’s home as an olive branch. The marriage naturally turned from the male lead’s original fiancee’s body to her head.
<br/><br/>
Afterwards, the two teamed up together. During the battle between Su Zhimo and Fu Shijun, the male lead had also expended lots of effort.
　　<br/><br/>
That’s why, at this banquet, it was originally supposed to be the male and female lead’s romantic first meeting.
<br/><br/>
However, it was regretful that female lead Su Zhimo was in prison crying against the barred window at this moment and had no way to leisurely come over to have her love at first sight with Li Wenzhuo.
　　<br/><br/>
Thinking to this point, Su Zui’s lips turned to a smile and he gave him a sincere congratulations: “I wish President Li’s marriage to be a joyful one. Lady Zhao and you are very compatible.”
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Seeing him smile, Li Wenzhuo became startled.
<br/><br/>
There were people that became more and more beautiful as they remained silent, yet lost their beauty when they move.
<br/><br/>
But there were some people that can only be considered warm when they have an indifferent expression. It couldn’t make people startled from the beauty. But when they laugh or cry, they could suddenly take over the other person’s whole attention.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui belonged to the latter. His smile was very faint but it didn’t prevent his whole appearance from becoming more lively.
<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo stared blankly at the faint impression of the dimples on Su Zui’s cheeks.
　　<br/><br/>
“President Li, let us have a toast.” A cold voice brought him back from reality.
<br/><br/>
“......” Li Wenzhuo raised his head and came in contact with Fu Shijun’s deep black eyes. His head felt numb as he dryly said: “......Thank you President Fu.”
<br/><br/>
In his heart, he felt completely bewildered and confused. Why did Fu Shijun s<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->uddenly became so hostile towards him? Weren’t they fine just now?
　　<br/><br/>
After toasting with Fu Shijun, Li Wenzhuo politely turned to Su Zui to toast with him.
<br/><br/>
As a result, Su Zui himself hasn’t even said anything yet before a distinct hand from the side reached over and took away the wine glass in Su Zui’s hand in an incomparably familiar manner. 
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s expression was indifferent: “He hadn’t ate much tonight. To drink wine on an empty stomach will only hurt it. I will drink this toast in his place.”
<br/><br/>
After he finished talking, he started drinking the glass of wine without stopping.
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo held his wine glass with a stupefied expression: ? ? ?
<br/><br/>
Although he knew that the relationship between the Fu and the Qin family wasn<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->’t bad before he came back, but he didn’t think that the relationship between Fu Shijun and Su Zui was good to this degree.
　　<br/><br/>
He can dare to say that even if the person was his childhood friend, he couldn’t be this considerate towards the other and drink wine in their place.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s glass of wine was already empty, yet he was still staring with a distracted expression. It was in actuality very impolite.
<br/><br/>
At his side, his fiancee’s smile became rigid. It was only when the hand that was on his arm unhesitantly pinched him that he returned to reality.
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo’s heart became startled due to the pinch but his face didn’t show anything. He forcefully endured the pain and laughed out loud and said: “President Fu is really straightforward. Even if I replenish my drink, I can’t fall behind.”
　　<br/><br/>
His family hasn’t have any collaborations with the Fu and Qin family recently so once the toasting was done, Fu Shijun and Su Zui went to another area.
<br/><br/>
Except Li Wenzhuo always felt that something wasn’t right and his gaze can’t help but follow the two.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing the two bumping heads to talk in a low voice from time to time with their limbs touching......his eyebrows became more wrinkled.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Until he saw Fu Shijun personally feed Su Zui a piece of cake that he had already bitten, he finally can’t resist. With a strange expression, he asked his fiancee: “President Fu and President Su, en......their personal relationship is very good?”
<br/><br/>
Why did he always feel like there is a gay atmosphere.
　　<br/><br/>
His tender, soft, and cute fiancee showed a surprised expression: “You don’t know?”
 <br/><br/>
She lightly released an “Ah” sound, as if to tell others of her surprise: “That’s right. You were shut away from news abroad. Not knowing that President Fu and President Su is a couple is very normal.”
　　<br/><br/>
His fiancee tighten her cheek muscles and gave him a warning look: “Even if you have any objections against homosexuals, you better hide it better. Don’t anger President Fu and President Su by making them unhappy and also implicating me.”
　　<br/><br/>
If the previous gossip had the misfortune to be in the hearing of the rightful owner, then the corpse will become so cold it couldn’t get any colder!
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo: ? ? ?
<br/><br/>
What? Did he develop hearing problems?<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
　　<br/><br/>
What about the established big family sons don’t have freedom of marriage? Why does the two of them get to be unrestrained and be gay together?!
　　<br/><br/>
　　<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
