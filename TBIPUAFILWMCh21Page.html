								Su Zui hasn’t walk a few steps before his arm was pulled from behind.
<br/><br/>
He subconsciously wanted to shake it off, but after he realized who it was, he slowly relaxed his muscles.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lightly pulled him. When he saw Su Zui stopped walking, he controlled himself and let go of Su Zui’s hand.
<br/><br/>
He looked at the lightly furious Su Zui, and in a rare confused manner, he hesitantly asked: “What happened?”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan had seized Su Zui’s mother’s position. Su Zhimo also snatched away the successor position for the Su Company that originally belonged to Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
While he knows Su Zui doesn’t value Su Family’s things, but this wasn’t an excuse to give it to Su Zhimo, this estranged outsider, for no reason.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui may not mind, but he had always remember it in his heart.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
When he brought Su Zui over to see the mother and daughter pair, he had originally wanted Su Zui to become a bit happier.
<br/><br/>
As a result, who could have thought that his originally still happy small friend actually became angry?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun felt a bit regretful: “I should have sent you home just now.”
<br/><br/>
After interacting for so long, he gradually discovered that Su Zui’s personality wasn’t as soft as he looked.
<br/><br/>
In his bones, Su Zui carried a bit of indifference and laziness. He couldn’t lose his self-control because he was happy, and he could very rarely be seriously angry.
<br/><br/>
Actually, when Su Zhimo and her mom did many disgusting things, Su Zui had never shown any resentment.
<br/><br/>
This was still the first time he had seen Su Zui acting out of the norm after meeting him.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Staring at Su Zui’s red ears, Fu Shijun still became slightly absent-minded even though he knew it wasn’t an appropriate time.
<br/><br/>
It was only after a few seconds that he slightly coughed and moved his gaze down to look at his small friend, whose eyes were slightly enlarged from anger, and asked in a low voice: “Should we go back? Don’t mind them. I’ll send you home.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t say anything. He only pinched the cup of milk tea in his hands and fiercely took a long sip, as if he had a very big grudge with the milk tea.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun also became silent. He then silently extended his hand and use the back of his hand to test the temperature of the milk tea.
<br/><br/>
The temperature had already dropped to the point that no warmth can be detected.
<br/><br/>
He used a low voice to remind Su Zui: “Xiao Zui, the milk tea has cooled. Don’t drink it anymore.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui paused in drinking his milk tea.
<br/><br/>
After a few seconds, he removed his mouth from the straw and stuffed the milk tea into the hands of the solemn man, and said without any expression: “Oh. Then throw it away.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun looked at the cold faced Su Zui and for the first time in his life, he didn’t know what to do.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t know what he was thinking but after staring at the cup of milk tea in his hand, he didn’t choose to throw the milk tea away, as if it was the main offender.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Instead, he bowed his head, covered the straw with his lips, and lightly drank a mouthful.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “............”
<br/><br/>
Did he just got taken advantage of right in front of his face?
<br/><br/>
System 555 used a small voice to remind him: “Host, Boss and you had an indirect kiss!”
<br/><br/>
The System excitedly danced in his heart without covering it up. There hasn’t been any movement in the side mission for a year. Was it finally time for a breakthrough?!
<br/><br/>
Only god knows how long it has been since it heard the sound of the mission progress reminder!
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......Shut up.” He wasn’t blind!
<br/><br/>
Being suddenly scolded, the system blanked for a moment. Its electronic voice had some dejection: “......Okay host.”
<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijun swallowed the mouthful of milk tea, he himself also became startled.
<br/><br/>
His whole body became ridgid, as if the milk tea in his hand was an enemy.
<br/><br/>
After hesitating for a few seconds, he hurriedly turned his body and threw the half filled milk tea into the nearby trash can.
<br/><br/>
As a result, the movement was too big and the accuracy dropped. The milk tea hit the edge of the trash can. Its cap flipped open and some warm liquid splashed out, leaving a few water marks on the back of his hand.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun paused for a moment before hurriedly taking out a napkin to wipe it off. As a result of his hands also being rigid, the napkin wasn’t even taken out before the whole napkin bag dropped into the trash can.
<br/><br/>
It fell down right next to criminal milk tea, all neat and tidy.
<br/><br/>
It was like it was soundlessly mocking him.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
The boss looked like he had suffered from a heavy loss. Why does it look like he had done something indescribably to the boss?
<br/><br/>
He was such a good overbearing president. How can he turn stupid as soon as someone said stupid?
<br/><br/>
There were already people attracted to their location due to their movement. He really didn’t want to be stared at like a monkey with Fu Shijun in the hospital, so he took out a napkin from his own pocket and hand it over.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lowered his head and accepted the napkin. After he quietly wiped clean his hand, he softly said: “Let’s go back.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui gave a soft “En”.
<br/><br/>
On the way back, Fu Shijun’s whole body was as rigid as before.
<br/><br/>
So much that Su Zui had no choice but to be focused. He looked at Fu Shijun then look at the road to prevent the car from driving into the gutter due to the boss’s nervousness.
<br/><br/>
When they reached Qin Family’s entrance, Fu Shijun, for the first time ever, didn’t patiently tell Su Zui a bunch of nonsense. Instead, he only hurriedly gave a few words of “take care of your body” before impatiently driving away.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at the black Lamborghini accelerating and leaving, and always felt that he saw a sense of fleeing in defeat from this image.
<br/><br/>
His mood was complex: “......The one panicking should be me?”
<br/><br/>
How can Fu Shijun panic to this extend? Was Fu Shijun that afraid that he will expose his feelings in front of hm?
<br/><br/>
He was originally a bit annoyed by Fu Shijun’s over the boundary behavior. As a result, the troublemaker acted as if the sky had fallen down, making him unable to become angry.
<br/><br/>
There as only a faint sense of helplessness. After it rolled around in his heart once, it quickly disappeared.
<br/><br/>
System 555 stealthy interjected: “Yea host. The boss wasn’t a bit brave!”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Seeing Su Zui didn’t tell it to shut up again, System 555 secretly sighed in relief in its heart.
<br/><br/>
Ai. Once he meets the side mission, the host can get really irritable!
<br/><br/>
Su Zui stood at the entrance for a while. No one knows what he was thinking. 
<br/><br/>
It was until the bodyguard came over and asked whether he had any order that he snapped out of it and shook his head.
<br/><br/>
He shut his eyes for a moment. By the time he reopened his eyes, his face had already returned to his original indifferent look, not letting people make out his mood.
<br/><br/>
Forget it. This is also an opportunity.
<br/><br/>
If Fu Shijun really can’t endure and extend his claws, he can also......seize this opportunity to chop it off.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
When Fu Shijun returned home, his brain was still blank.
<br/><br/>
He stopped the car, but he didn’t get off and return home. Instead, he put his hand on the steering wheel and his leaned his back on the chair. He expelled a big breath in disappointment.
<br/><br/>
He also didn’t know what he was thinking at that time to actually bite the straw Su Zui had used before right in front of Su Zui’s face.
<br/><br/>
This type of suggestion, even a stupid person can tell that something wasn’t right.
<br/><br/>
There were friends that will drink from the same cup, but he and Su Zui’s interactions were always very polite. The action he did just now was really over the line.
<br/><br/>
He had obviously controlled himself nicely for a year. Why was he suddenly unable to restrain himself? 
<br/><br/>
He attempted to analyze his feelings at that time. As a result, he couldn’t think of anything. His brain was full of Su Zui’s red ear due to anger and the tooth marks on the straw from where the youth had been biting. 
<br/><br/>
It was as if it had been cemented into his brain. No matter how many times he closed his eyes, the images still couldn’t be wiped away.
<br/><br/>
An indescribable warm feeling spread throughout his chest. His throat was intolerably dry. After a moment, he can’t help but use his tongue to wet his lips.
<br/><br/>
Just at this time, a “dong dong dong” sound appeared from someone loudly knocking on the window.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Fu Shijun: “............”
<br/><br/>
He turned his head sideways. Separated by a window, he saw Fu Shijing’s troublemaking face.
<br/><br/>
He took a deep breath and lowered the windows. With the last of his patience, he said: “......Get lost.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing: ? ? ?
<br/><br/>
What did he do! He didn’t even make any trouble yet today!
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

Zui Zui: An executioner once he sees emotions appearing (●─●)
