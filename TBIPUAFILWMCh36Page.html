With two handsome men kicking chests and kissing the foot in a beach full of people, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this scene was more colorful than public kissing.
<br/><br/>
This country was very open. When passer byers saw this scene, they only kindly laugh and some let out “wows”. There were even some that shouted to them to “kiss again.”
　　<br/><br/>
With a desire to show off that appeared out of who knows where, Fu Shijun was very cooperative and kissed Su Zui’s slender ankle once again.
<br/><br/>
The roars of laughter became bigger. Su Zui even saw a young lady very excitedly raised her cell phone seemingly to take a picture.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui supported his own forehead. He really doesn't understand how did President Fu became so childish and rebellious. To become like that of a teenager......will he continue to revert as he continues to live?
　　<br/><br/>
He really didn’t want to appear in some strange gossips. As a result, he stepped on this person’s stomach not light but not heavy and stopped coaxing him. He slightly used some strength and nimbly pulled his ankle from that person’s hands.
　　<br/><br/>
In a stressed half warning tone: “If you continue to cause a ruckus, you can open up your own room tonight.”
<br/><br/>
President Fu didn’t utter a word and sat upright, and eagerly helped him open a coconut as if he really receive a lecture.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui once again laid in the chair like a salty fish for a while and drank a bellyful of coconut water. In the end, he was pulled to the seashore by Fu Shijun and without even swimming for a thousand meters, he felt that he had already completed all the exercise he needed today and gave a notice to the two grandfathers before returning to the hotel under the setting sun.
　　<br/><br/>
Reality proved that President Fu was not only a childish person, he was very childish.
<br/><br/>
Not only did he remember his grudges, he would also cascade it into a big snowball in his small notebook.
　　<br/><br/>
After returning to the seaside hotel, he pressed down Su Zui and from the upper surface of the foot, he would kiss it all the way up, as if to make up for the matter of Su Zui not letting him kiss in broad daylight.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui pushed Fu Shijun’s head that was pressed into his chest: “The sunscreen still hasn’t been washed off yet.” Aren’t you afraid of heavy metal poisoning from all the biting?
<br/><br/>
After a moment, he continued to say: “......Don’t bite over there.”
<br/><br/>
If he became swollen from his biting, how will he go out to see people tomorrow!
　　<br/><br/>
The man stuck to his chest like a dog skin plaster. Su Zui was pressed onto the floor for half a day, and it was only after his whole body was full of red marks that he finally managed to push the person off and nimbly went to take a shower.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was blocked off at the door and can only wait for him to finish showering before he went in to shower.
　　<br/><br/>
Taking advantage that Fu Shijun still wasn’t out yet, Su Zui ordered dinner and sat on a rattan chair as he rearranged his storage space.
　　<br/><br/>
The mission to inherit the family business had been completed a while ago. After the experience points from the two main missions entered into his account, he was no longer that pauper that had a headache just from buying a bottle of Constitution Strengthening Reagent.
<br/><br/>
Except the side mission was still stuck in the end.
　　<br/><br/>
Attacking the boss mission had stopped at the eighty percent mark for a few years, as if someone pressed the stop button. There was not an inch of improvement.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui wasn’t clear what was the final clearance mark, but he didn’t doubt Fu Shijun’s feelings for him.
　　<br/><br/>
After looking for awhile but was unable to find any hints, Su Zui stopped looking. Just as he was about to exit, he saw a golden flashy item. He stopped for a moment before taking it out.
<br/><br/>
This was the artifact that he told the system to buy that day when Fu Shijun suddenly kissed him in the bathroom.
<br/><br/>
It was only that in the end, he didn’t have the determination to use it and had left it in the storage space to gather dirt.
<br/><br/>
[Forget Card-Immediate Version]
<br/><br/>
[Rank: B]
<br/><br/>
[Property: Single-time usage]
<br/><br/>
[Effect: After use, the affected person can forget their memory up to the past thirty minutes. The effects are permanent in that world.]
<br/><br/>
[Usage Restriction: Can only be used on living creatures.]
<br/><br/>
[Summary: Zhuang Zi<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> didn’t see a butterfly when he woke up. When the mermaid walk up the cliff to become bubbles when the sun rises, the memory that you left me at night will be completely forgotten when the day becomes bright.]
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” This foolish summary was already enough and let’s not even mention the messily combination of Western and Eastern elements, but how can it still secretly start driving the car?<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a>
<br/><br/>
Looks like the system that ying ying ying in front of him the whole day wasn’t a proper system at all.
　　<br/><br/>
System 555: “Ying ying ying.”
<br/><br/>
But System really doesn’t know anything!
　　<br/><br/>
This artifact card’s entire body was a faint gold color. The front was a half disappeared butterfly and the back was a row of bubbles. Small diamonds were arranged to be a faint sunshine at the corner of the card. The work was very delicate and the weight was fairly heavy. If he didn’t know any better, he could have thought this was some expensive art piece. 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui thought in his heart that to use one thousand experience points to buy this was really......a big loss!
<br/><br/>
A bit of cold and a few diamonds can cost how much? This was worth a thousand points......a thousand points. If he round up to the nearest integer, he can buy two bottles of Constitution Strengthening Reagent. Those are priceless treasures that even money can’t buy.
<br/><br/>
Every single time Su Zui thought about the wasted experience points, he could be unable to restrain himself from sighing. Falling in love really cost a lot.
　　<br/><br/>
Just when he let out a sigh, a pair of distinctly jointed hands appeared from behind and lightly took away the card in his hand, and a deep voice sounded in his ears as its owner bent their waist and asked: “What is this?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui turned his head to look at him with a peaceful expression: “It’s nothing. Just a small toy. Aren’t you tired bending your waist that low? Come sit down.”
　　<br/><br/>
The room they open was a couple suite and even the rattan chair was a couple rattan chair. It wasn’t difficult for two grown men to sit down together.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun obediently sat down, except the way he didn’t sit down properly and absolutely insisted on hugging Su Zui up, sitting himself down, and then place Su Zui on top of himself. He extended his long arms and legs and easily squeezed Su Zui into his embrace.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” He always felt that President Fu was like a turtle nesting when he acted like this.
<br/><br/>
But even if he secretly dissed him in his heart, he still didn’t climb out in the every end.
<br/><br/>
This comfortable soft and hard human figure chair, it’s a waste to not lay on it.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had just finished showering and his body still carry a bit of cold moisture. Combined with his body’s original smell, it was as if it will swallow a person deeply, but Su Zui was already used to the smell. If there was a day he didn’t smell it, he would feel uneasy. 
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun stared at that delicate card in his hand for half a day before tightening his jaw and threw it towards the table near the very corner where the flower vase sat. His gaze flashed with deep melancholy.
　　<br/><br/>
Although it only looks like a flashy product, but without knowing why, from the moment he came out of the bathroom and saw that card, a danger warning rised from his heart. When he took that card from Su Zui’s hands, he had already had the notion of firmly throwing it away.
<br/><br/>
He had already not felt this type of danger for a very long time. Even when a multibillion project entered the danger zone, he had never felt close to this type of sharp unease. 
<br/><br/>
It was as if as long as this card continued to exist, it would steal away his most precious thing.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui keenly sensed his sudden drop of mood. He really understood Fu Shijun too much to the point that he didn’t even need to think to understand whether this person was happy or gloomy. He raised his eyebrows and asked: “What happened? Who angered you now?”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun used his head to rub against Su Zui’s shoulders a couple of times. His frantic words carried his selfishness: “That card, is ugly.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” What should he say? A beast’s intuition?
　　<br/><br/>
“Ugly!” Seeing how he didn’t say anything, Fu Shijun once again emphasised in a deep and strong voice.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui had no choice but to smooth his fur: “Ok ok ok. It’s ugly.”
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, to a normal person’s taste, this card was actually very pretty to look at. But to Fu Shijun, this was indeed not a very good item. His dislike, or even his hostility, was actually very normal.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun saw that he also agreed with his view and became calm. When he saw that Su Zui wasn’t paying attention, he took advantage of the moment and pushed that card under the flower vase, as if attempting to cover up its missing location.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” Then he should just pretend that he didn’t see anything.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing that he can no longer see that incomparably irksome card, Fu Shijun finally became less annoyed.
<br/><br/>
The hand that was originally hanging on Su Zui’s waist slowly moved downwards.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui’s physique was slender, but it wasn’t slim to the point of a skeleton rack, so much that when he moves people can see their skeleton. His physique was slender. Although his weight was light, but there was still a layer of light and apparent muscles that was well proportioned and laid on top of his body. If there was an extra layer of muscles, then it would look wrong. If there was a layer less, then his body will look wasted away. Su Zui’s physique was like an artwork that had been meticulously crafted; without a stroke more and without a strokeless.
　　<br/><br/>
Very few people knew, this body, which looked as if it were a carcass delicately cherished in a greenhouse, actually contained a very strong strength that normal people had a very hard time associating it with.
　　<br/><br/>
Other people don’t know but Fu Shijun does know. Not long after he and Su Zui lived together, he discovered that Su Zui actually wasn’t as soft and weak as he thought before. Instead, Su Zui’s strength and slender appearance were two complete opposites. His techniques in wrestling were very skilled.
　　<br/><br/>
If they were to seriously fight it out, Fu Shijun didn’t dare to guarantee that he would completely grasp victory.
<br/><br/>
Even if he were to really win, it would most likely be because he had a bit more advantage in his physique.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui actually always had the strength to push him off but since the start, he had never done this.
　　<br/><br/>
The sea breeze blew in from the half opened window and brought a faint salty moisture. The original sea breeze that would refresh a person’s mind only turned the gradually humid atmosphere more dense when it blew into the room.
　　<br/><br/>
When his bathrobe was torn open, Su Zui subconsciously wanted to shrink back, but his whole body was embraced tightly by Fu Shijun, and like a meat tied to a chopping board, he was unable to really move and can only be spread apart and allow the person to do whatever they please.
　　<br/><br/>
Just when his earlobe was enduring chewing from Fu Shijun’s mouth, he suddenly felt that person who was chewing him paused and used a low ambiguous tone to ask him: “......Zui Zui, do you like me?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui slowly raised his eyes and looked into the pair of deep black eyes and felt a bit shaken by the other’s question: “If I don’t like you, will I still go to bed with you?”
<br/><br/>
Did he look like those casual people?
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s eyes shined for a second but he still stubbornly stared at him and used his actions to express that he wanted an explicit answer.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui can only compromise: “......Like. Like you the most.”
<br/><br/>
If they continued to drag it out, he will turn soft. He really doesn't know how Fu Shijun could endure and battle with him here. Really a ruthless person.
　　<br/><br/>
It was only then that Fu Shijun became satisfied, “I also like you the most. Ever since that day I saw you at the banquet, I already like you. It was only that I didn’t notice it then.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. At the same time, a part of his heart softly collapsed. He raised his head to bump Fu Shijun’s lips.
　　<br/><br/>
The man’s returning kiss very quickly went downwards. The moment the lips pressed together, Su Zui heard the side mission completion notification.
　　<br/><br/>
[Ding! Side mission 1: Be a winner in life (Attack male lead/female lead/boss). Completion status: 60%]
<br/><br/>
[Novice’s early reward system had already transferred 2000 experience points to your account; please make sure it has been received! Congratulations to the Host for completing the side mission! The withheld experience points has already been completely deposited to your account!]
<br/><br/>
[Who could have thought that the unfeeling! Cruel! Overbearing! Overbearing president’s heart was actually that of a soft youth? Or maybe his heart was actually not the say once and not twice overbearing president but instead a small young dog! No matter what, all roads lead to Rome! No matter if it’s a black cat or a white cat, a cat that can catch a mouse is a good cat. Congratulations to the small cannon fodder for releasing the troubles in the boss’s heart, successfully marrying the boss, and enjoy the luck halo together and become winners in life! Look! This whole world was prepared for you by the boss!]
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”Alright. President Fu’s thought process and the system’s vocabulary are all very strange.
　　<br/><br/>
He was really suspicious whether this turtle spirit President Fu has a small notebook or not and was using it to record his shortcomings.
<br/><br/>
The confession that wasn’t directly answered for a few years was still remember very clearly by him.
　　<br/><br/>
As the golden sun fell below the sea horizon, Su Zui’s voice became lower and used a half hoarse voice to warn him: “You are not allowed to bite anymore......”
　　<br/><br/>
After that shallow golden card was pressed under the flower vase for a few hours, it automatically returned to Su Zui’s artifact box. All the way until he died of old age and left this world, it wasn’t used at all.

Thirty years later.
<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo lead his fiancee——no, to be precise, his already married wife’s hand and walked into the shopping mall.
　　<br/><br/>
He stopped at a family store and personally chose a rose red fleece cloak for his wife: “I feel that you will look very pretty in this piece.”
<br/><br/>
His wife stared at that deathly rose red color for a few seconds before laughing dryly: “Your straight male aesthetics really doesn’t change even after ten years.”
　　<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo didn’t become angry at all from the ridiculement and only said: “Other people doesn’t look good in it, but your complexion is white. I feel that maybe it won’t look too bad.”
　　<br/><br/>
Although his wife very much reject this deathly rose red color, but she only snorted about it for a moment before awkwardly grabbing the cloth and enter the dressing room.
　　<br/><br/>
The shopping assistant’s mouth was very sweet as they flattered: “Mister and his madam’s feelings are really good.”
<br/><br/>
Li Wenzhuo smiled but didn’t say anything.
　　<br/><br/>
He and his wife had a business marriage. At the start when he hurriedly returned home to marry, he didn’t feel anything. This made him originally felt that his own marriage will become tasteless and boring.
　　<br/><br/>
But as time passed and he interacted with his wife more, he actually found out this delicate and cute woman wasn’t as warm and gentle as she looked.
<br/><br/>
In front of people, she would always wear a smile that no one could pick faults on, but whenever he did something wrong, she would take joy in his misfortune and roast him.
<br/><br/>
He didn’t love her but she also wasn’t polite and only remained respectable in front of him.
　　<br/><br/>
But it was this self-willed attitude that let him, who felt as if he was drowning in stagnant water, felt that the world became lively again. When he held his wife’s hand in his wedding, he suddenly felt that this marriage partner was actually not that bad.
　　<br/><br/>
After that, they followed the prescribed order of marriage, work, and having kids. And without knowing when, maybe twenty years ago, or maybe ten years ago, he suddenly discovered that he already can’t adapt to a life without his wife.
　　<br/><br/>
His mouth held in a laughter. Just when he was remembering the times he had with his wife, he suddenly saw a cleaning janitor passing by and became startled.
<br/><br/>
That was a middle aged woman with grizzled hair and was haggard and silent like the countless middle aged women who had worked excessively. The only thing different was that that fully wrinkled face had very good feature placement and from this, she was most likely a beauty.
　　<br/><br/>
He stared at that janitor that had their head lowered as they swept the floors. Without knowing why, he suddenly felt a bit frustrated, as if something possessed him, and got a sudden urge to go talk to her.
　　<br/><br/>
But at this time, his wife came out of the dressing room and was a bit unhappy as she summoned him: “Old Li, come and see the cloth you picked out.”
<br/><br/>
Rose red was usually a color associated with death and can cause a person with a seven star appearance to drop to a four star appearance, but his wife’s appearance was fair, tall, and slender. Combined with a graceful temperament, the combination with this gorgeous saturated color only made her more alluring and beautiful.
　　<br/><br/>
In a flash, he forgot about that strange janitor and gave his wife a perfectly satisfied smile and said: “Aiya, why is Madam Li wrinkling her brows? Isn’t this very beautiful?”

Years passed by in a flash. After experiencing a complete life, when Su Zui once again opened his eyes, he found that he was sitting in a car.
<br/><br/>
His expression was a bit distracted. He opened up his slender fingers and faintly curled, as if it was grabbing something that doesn’t exist anymore.
