								Due to the effects of that bottle of Constitution Strengthening Reagent, Fu Shijun only stayed in the hospital for one week before removing his stitches without any problems and left the hospital.
<br/><br/>
Actually, the arm was not an area where it would hinder movement. If Fu Shijun’s condition was stable three or four days after the surgery, he could have gone home to recover.
<br/><br/>
But because Grandfather Fu received such a big stimulation from him, Grandfather Qin, in a rare moment, was unyielding and wouldn’t let his son leave the hospital early. It was only due to this that he left after he removed his stitches.
　　<br/><br/>
A bone fracture in the arm generally has its stitches removed around the<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> twelfth day. For Fu Shijun to remove his stitches after a week, it was an indication that the injury was recovering really well.
<br/><br/>
His primary physician can’t help but feel regret: “Mr. Fu, your body constitution is really good. Your self healing is really strong. If you actively come to therapy in the future, your right arm might heal and recover seventy to eighty percent of its original strength.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face was the same as always. It made people unable to see his feelings: “I understand. Thank you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was standing by his side and gave his thanks together with Fu Shijun. He didn’t express any objection to the doctor’s “pessimistic” prediction.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s arm will definitely get better, but it wasn’t necessary for him to refute the doctor.
<br/><br/>
When the arm heal in the future, the others will naturally know.
　　<br/><br/>
He had deliberately feed that bottle of Constitution Strengthening Reagent late.
<br/><br/>
If Fu Shijun was to drink it right after his surgery, then he may become a miracle by removing his stitches after three days.
<br/><br/>
But if he had done that, besides giving Fu Shijun a lot of additional trouble, it didn’t have any meaning.

When Fu Shijun got out of the hospital, the whole Fu Family gathered together to eat dinner.
<br/><br/>
They even invited Su Zui and Grandfather Qin.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had lived in the hospital for a week. Just how diligent Su Zui accompanied him was very clear in the eyes of the Fu Family.
<br/><br/>
The friendship between the two family’s elders were originally very good. Now, the younger generation is setting up such a deep friendship. While no one claims that it is a family-like relationship, it wasn’t far off.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin sighed: “Looking at those two kids. Their relationship is better than ours when we were young.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu were beaming as he nodded: “Our two family are still bound by fate.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at the two elder’s joyful discussion and suddenly remembered a part of the original plot.
<br/><br/>
When Grandfather Qin was angered to death by the bed photo of the original and when the original hurriedly took over the Qin Corporation, the Fu Family had actually gave help to the original.
　　<br/><br/>
At that time, the prestigious owner of the Qin Corporation suddenly died.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> The new owner was a youngster without a bit of experience and was even the main culprit for the prestigious owner’s death. The entire atmosphere in the Qin Corporation was very bad.
<br/><br/>
The main shareholders in the board of directors was very unsatisfied with this new owner. Besides the original’s uncle always wanting to drive him out, the female lead was also silently stirring up the waters.
<br/><br/>
Not even the saying “internal trouble and outside aggression” can fully describe the original’s difficult situation.
　　<br/><br/>
Being a successor who was pushed to do tasks way beyond his ability, the original was unable to manage such a huge corporation and the problems quickly arose in the Qin Corporation.
<br/><br/>
The collaborators, who worked with the Qin Corporation previously, saw that that its strength has decreased and they began to cut off their collaborations with the Qin Corporation one by one.
<br/><br/>
It was only the Fu Family, when everyone cannot see a good future for the Qin Corporation, gave the Qin Corporation a big order.
　　<br/><br/>
This order. Even if one was to close their eyes, they could still know that this will result in a big loss.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun wouldn’t do a business where he would lose money so this should have came from remembrance and friendship by Grandfather Fu has towards Grandfather Qin and done as an attempt to save his old friend’s long family business.
　　<br/><br/>
Yet this helpful order was only drinking poison to quench one’s thirst.
<br/><br/>
The Fu Family’s order let the Qin Corporation temporarily have a breath o<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->f relief. But it was only a breath.
　　<br/><br/>
Very quickly, under countless pressure, the original finally lost all the shares in his hands to Yang Yuanhang and Su Zhimo, and the Qin Corporation switched owners.
<br/><br/>
At that time, Su Zhimo and Fu Shijun was already endlessly battling.
<br/><br/>
That was the entire book’s most important battle. The original’s appearance and disappearance was nothing more than a grain of sand compared to it.
　　<br/><br/>
While Su Zui was still immersed in the original plot, Grandfather Fu gave him a chopstick full of vegetables and suddenly said: “Since Xiao Zui called me “Grandpa” and I also don’t mind, why don’t I recognize you as my god-grandson and love you like one in the future? Old Qin, what do you think?”
　　<br/><br/>
Without waiting for Grandfather Qin’s reply, there was suddenly a strange noise from another person at the dining table.
　　<br/><br/>
“PU——”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing spit his mouthful of wine onto the floor. He wiped his face, raised his head, and shout in horror: “......You can’t! You can’t! Dad, you can’t recognize Xiao Zui as your god-grandson!”
　　<br/><br/>
If his dad recognize Su Zui as his god-grandson. Then by relation, won’t his little brother become Su Zui’s godfather?!
<br/><br/>
Then how can they become intimate?<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
It can’t be that those dog blooded scenarios that he had read was passed onto his little brother’s hand in the end?
　　<br/><br/>
Titles like “Overbearing Godfather: The Visiting Son Is Too Clingy” or “Famous Family Vigorously Pampers: Black Belly Godfather Loves Me” suddenly lined up and appeared in his mind!
<br/><br/>
......This is all because of the BL stories he had read after being scared by those romance fictional stories he read before and causing him to feel frantic!
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu felt very unsatisfied: “Shijing! What are you saying? Tell me, why can’t I recognize Xiao Zui as my god-grandson?!”
　　<br/><br/>
“I, I——”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing “I”ed for half a day but was unable to spell out any reasons why.
<br/><br/>
It wasn’t as if he can simply say that Su Zui may become intimate with your son and this will simply make their relationship improper?
　　<br/><br/>
This type of seeking death talk! He might as well jump directly into their family’s garden pond and drown himself!
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu saw his making trouble yet not explaining himself look. He<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> raised his eyebrow and heavily put down the wine glass in his hands to the table: “Do you have some objection against Xiao Zui? He had painstakingly take care of your brother for so long and is so capable and patient. How could you criticize him? This objection of yours has no meaning!”
　　<br/><br/>
The old man got angry!
<br/><br/>
In a panic, Fu Shijing looked towards Fu Shijun and frantically send him a help signal.
<br/><br/>
Who......who was he doing this for? If Fu Shijun was willing to see him get scolded like this, then he is really too heartless!
　　<br/><br/>
Reality proofed that Fu Shijun wasn’t cold-blooded to that degree.
<br/><br/>
“Don’t be angry,” he calmly said: “Second Brother probably doesn’t mean it that way. Don’t you know him? His brain isn’t great but his heart isn’t bad.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing: “......”
<br/><br/>
If you keep telling truths like this, I’m going to get angry!
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Grandfather Fu still felt angry: “There are guests present. How can you be impolite and change the topic? Where did you learn this from?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s expression didn’t change as he continued to talk nonsense: “Maybe Second Brother felt that since Xiao Zui is from the younger generation, he isn’t used to indulging the elders like this.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing: “......Right right right! That’s what I meant!”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu was still snorting: “What indulging elders?”
<br/><br/>
But his face was clearly better.
<br/><br/>
He was too impatient to listen to the quibbles of his troublemaking second son. However, towards his calm and reliable youngest son, he would unconsciously trust him.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun refilled Grandfather Fu’s tea cup: “A title is nothing but a name. It can’t be that just because you don’t recognize Su Zui as your god-grandson, our Fu Family can’t love him anymore? Drink less wine.”
　　<br/><br/>
Without waiting for Grandfather Fu’s response, he continued talking: “How about this. If Xiao Zui doesn’t mind, he can be my assistant for a while and follow me.”
　　<br/><br/>
Once the sentence was said, the whole table became dumbstruck.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Being an assistant. On the surface, it appears that Su Zui was working for Fu Shijun. However, Fu Shijun was already a famous person in the business world for several years. Any small matter that Su Zui learns from following around Fu Shijun will still be better than studying for a few months by himself.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin immediately rejected: “This is too much of an inconvenience to you. It’s not suitable.”
<br/><br/>
Although this opportunity is rare, but he felt bad accepting it.
<br/><br/>
The matters Fu Shijun deals with are all Fu Corporation’s inside information. If Su Zui, someone from another company, learned too much, it won’t be a good thing in the end.
<br/><br/>
Even if the relationship between friends are good, they still need to maintain their guard.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “It isn’t anything not suitable. For the past few days, all my work was typed by Xiao Zui. For the next few months, I can’t use my arm and still need to bother Xiao Zui. So to say, it will be me that will be bothering him.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin started to feel awkward: “This......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had already spoke to this point. If he continues to reject his offer, it will only bring up unfounded suspicions. 
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu snapped out of his shock. After thinking about it for awhile, he joyfully said: “It could be better if we listen to Shijun.”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Although he also felt that it wasn’t good to let Su Zui to come in contact with the Fu Corporation’s inner information, but he trusts his son’s judgement.
<br/><br/>
Since Fu Shijun felt that Su Zui can know these information, then it is fine.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “Xiao Zui should prepare. I’ll pick you up tomorrow for work.”
<br/><br/>
The distance between their two families weren’t far. Even if he was reluctant to do so, it was still on the way.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was quietly listening throughout the whole process. It was only when Fu Shijun looked over that he nodded his head and gave a soft smile: “Ok.”
　　<br/><br/>
And the matter was decided just like that.
<br/><br/>
Because Grandfather Qin became completely distracted by Fu Shijun’s suggestion, he forgot his desire to recognize Su Zui as his god-grandson in the first place.

The second day around eight o’clock, the receptionist finally saw their chairman/CEO, who had been missing work for one week due to injuries.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Once she looked over, her eyes became crisscrossed.
　　<br/><br/>
It wasn’t because of their CEO’s sharp and handsome face. After all, even if he became more handsome, if a person see it for a few years, they will gain a bit of immunity.
<br/><br/>
It was because there was an obedient looking youth following behind their CEO.
<br/><br/>
Think hair and black eyes. Their appearance was soft and obedient like water. When he laughs, dimples appear on his face. Not only did he look refined, he also has a noble atmosphere. Even though he was wearing a formal suit, it wasn’t able to disguise that harmless aura he has.
　　<br/><br/>
She was able to hear pieces of information from people passing by and found out that person was President Fu’s assistant.
<br/><br/>
There are a number of assistants for the CEO and the receptionist had remember every single one of them clearly.
<br/><br/>
That face and that temperament, if she had seen them before, she would definitely have an impression!
　　<br/><br/>
He should be new.
<br/><br/>
Compared to President Fu and his assistants, whom always have a cold face, this obedient looking assistant is really different from them!
<br/><br/>
And what was even weirder was that even though she felt that he looks very obedient, his manners and atmosphere didn’t look like the type who is willing to be an assistant to another person......
　　<br/><br/>
She was bewildered by this new assistant for the whole morning. It wasn’t<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io--> until she met a familiar senior executive and seized her chance to ask a few questions that she found out what is going on.
<br/><br/>
“Oh, that. That was Qin Family’s small successor. He is following President Fu and acting as an assistant to learn for a while. This matter isn’t made to public so you shouldn’t talk about it to outsiders.”
　　<br/><br/>
Receptionist: ? ? ?
<br/><br/>
Another corporation’s successor is taking on the role of an assistant for their CEO. What is this?!
<br/><br/>
Being this close, were the two corporations’ heirs planning on getting married?
　　<br/><br/>
