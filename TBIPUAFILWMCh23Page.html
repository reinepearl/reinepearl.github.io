								The cellphone continued to be static for another half a minute before a low male voice was heard.
<br/><br/>
“Noth-nothing. Only a small mishap happened......”
<br/><br/>
He can actually still talk.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui felt his ice cold hands slowly became a bit warmer.
<br/><br/>
“You are still trying to act strong right now?!” He coldy interrupted Fu Shijun’s sentence. He fired questions at him one after the other: “Did you have a car accident? Did you call the police? Can you still move? Hurry up and get out of the car!”
<br/><br/>
Knowing that Fu Shijun was temporarily not in danger and that the doctor was quickly arriving, Su Zui turned on his car and drove towards the hospital.
<br/><br/>
He let the system hack into the nearby traffic light systems and plan the shortest route, where the whole route had no traffic nor red light.
<br/><br/>
The call continued to be maintained. The voice from the other side transmitted in broken parts.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The ambulance’s siren was heard beside the man’s heavy breathing. It was a messy scene, but it still gave people a sense of peace.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun knew he was driving so he didn’t speak when he didn’t need to. It was only until his cellphone was quickly running out of battery that he quietly said: “I arrived at the hospital. I am really fine. You don’t have to worry too much.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui heard him pretending to be strong and can’t help but became angry: “Shut up! I will use my own eyes to see whether you are okay or not!”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was scolded and didn’t dare to talk back. After a moment, he said in a hoarse voice: “......Ok. You can come and see. Don’t be angry. My cellphone is quickly running out of battery. Be careful while driving. Don’t get distracted.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “En. I know.”
<br/><br/>
While he was dissatisfied at the always dishonest boss, but he still listened to him and lowered the driving speed of the car by a bit.
<br/><br/>
But even like this, throughout the whole trip, he still drove right under the speed limit and made the business version of the Maybach drive look like a racing car.
<br/><br/>
The distance between the Qin Family and the hospital was a bit far. By the time he arrived at the hospital, an hour has already passed.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had already entered the surgery room. There were only worried Fu Family members waiting outside.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Seeing him arrive, Fu Shijing’s expression became complicated.
<br/><br/>
His little brother went out to find him to repent only to get into a car accident. 
<br/><br/>
But he knows that this matter cannot be blamed on Su Zui. Even when his little brother was about to enter the surgery room, he was still looking at his cellphone like he was using his cellphone to substitute for another person.
<br/><br/>
He became focused and voluntarily explained to Su Zui: “How come you came? Don’t worry. Shijun’s injuries isn’t big. The only injury was on his arm. Everywhere else was fine.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing hesitated a moment but didn’t persuade Su Zui to leave: “You should sit down and the side and wait. The surgery still needs a couple more hours.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui shook his head: “There’s no need.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu, who was being supported by the people of the Fu Family on one side, was a bit absentminded. He waited for Su Zui and Fu Shijing to finish talking before slowly said: “Xiao Zui also came? Be good. Don’t wait with us. It’s too much of a waste of time.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui pursed his lips and bluntly said: “Uncle was coming to meet me when he ran into this car accident. I’ll also wait.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu was startled for a moment.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Fu Shijun hadn’t said anything, making him clueless about this matter.
<br/><br/>
But he wasn’t an unreasonable person. After he snapped out of it, he gently told Su Zui that he wasn’t responsible before sitting down to rest with an exhausted face.
<br/><br/>
Being an elder and seeing his son covered in blood when he entered the surgery room, he really couldn’t hold on anymore.
<br/><br/>
After two hours, Fu Shijun was finally pushed out of the surgery room.
<br/><br/>
The doctor took off his mask: “Everything went smoothly. If there isn’t any problems within the observation period, then his condition has basically stabilized.”
<br/><br/>
With their hearts full of joy, the members of the Fu Family surrounded Fu Shijun to talk to him.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui stood at the back and waited for the gurney to reach him before raising his eyes to take a look.
<br/><br/>
The man laying on the bed had a deathly pale face and his face and neck have small cuts from glass fragments. His right arm was tightly covered with a thick cast, not allowing people to see its condition.
<br/><br/>
Maybe it was because the anesthesia haven’t exited his system, but Fu Shijun’s eyes were drooping as if he didn’t have any energy.
<br/><br/>
Laying on the snow white bed sheets, he had a rare fragile look.
<br/><br/>
His face color didn’t look good, but his pair of black eyes flashed with light. When he saw Su Zu<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->i, he arduously raised his non-injured arm.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui subconsciously extended his own hand forward.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun hooked his fingertips and said a few words in a light but uncertain tone: “......I am really ok. I’m not lying.”
<br/><br/>
The man that just got out of surgery actually didn’t have any strength. If Su Zui used just a bit of force, he can extract his fingertips from the ice cold hand.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui hesitated a moment. Ultimately, he didn’t make any movement.
<br/><br/>
He narrowed his eyes and splashed cold water onto Fu Shijun: “Wait until the observation period is over before saying you are fine.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun unhesitatingly changed his words: “......I’ll listen to you.”
<br/><br/>
A few of the Fu Family members on the side looked at the pair caring for each other under a cold atmosphere and constantly felt that there was something weird with the scene.
<br/><br/>
Especially Fu Shijing. When he saw the two hold hands, his eyes became crisscrossed. 
<br/><br/>
Did this count as experiencing a fortune from a misfortune for his little brother?
<br/><br/>
He peeked at the fragile looking Fu Shijun and constantly felt that this person had already secretly blast off fireworks in his heart......
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Because Fu Shijun needed to enter the patient room, Su Zui and Fu Shijun held hands for a while before separating.
<br/><br/>
Because a family member had just escaped danger, the Fu Family didn’t have time to think about any messy stuff. While they had felt that Su Zui and Fu Shijun’s relationship was a bit better than normal, but they didn’t think too deeply about it.
<br/><br/>
Even Grandfather Fu, who was originally especially sensitive toward this matter, also missed out. He held Fu Shijing and contentedly sighed: “Xiao Zui is a good child. The responsibility of this matter originally didn’t need to be pushed towards him. He was already so busy everyday but he is still so mindful. Our Fu Family needs to remember this friendship.”
<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing, who only knows a bit of the truth, sank into a deep silence.
<br/><br/>
Okay. Friendship.

Fu Shijun’s car accident wasn’t an accident.
<br/><br/>
While he had a fault for driving without focus, but the main reason was still because a truck illegally made a lane change.
<br/><br/>
According to Fu Shijun’s oral confession to the police later, the condition at that time was especially perilous.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t for Fu Shijun immediately dodging, then the arm won’t be the only thing that was injured.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
Su Zui heard about this detail and his face completely became cold.
<br/><br/>
In the original plot, Fu Shijun’s car accident was caused by a truck illegally made a lane change.
<br/><br/>
It was exactly the same without a single change.
<br/><br/>
It was only that the Fu Shijun in the original story wasn’t as lucky as now. Both of his legs were crushed and unhealable, causing him to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
<br/><br/>
He originally thought that because Fu Shijun didn’t lose the family battle to the female lead, he wouldn’t receive the injuries from the later part of the plot.
<br/><br/>
But looking at it now, it seems that he was thinking too simply.
<br/><br/>
A starved camel was still bigger than a horse. A doomed female lead’s luck halo was still stronger than that of the villain’s.
<br/><br/>
While Su Zhimo had already been tormented by him and Fu Shijun until she didn’t even look like a female lead, but as long as the luck halo on top of her head didn't disappear, then it was like a bomb that can explode anytime to Fu Shijun.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Naturally, the police officers weren’t able to find discover anything.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The truck was severely damaged and the law breaker driver had died on the spot. The dead cannot testify. In the end, this matter can only be classified as an occasional traffic accident.
<br/><br/>
Except there are some matter that didn’t require conclusive evidence.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s heart should already have some doubt. The system had found that he had let people investigate whether this matter and Su Zhimo had any connections but was unable to discover anything.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had not discuss his doubts with Su Zui; most likely to not let him worry and Su Zui also didn’t expose him.
<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijun’s condition stabilized, Su Zui sent a dove<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> to the company and took a brief leave to accompany him.
<br/><br/>
Besides the already retired Grandfather Fu and the playing all day Fu Shijing, all the Fu Family members were busy.
<br/><br/>
In addition, Grandfather Fu was already old and shouldn’t be worrying everyday. In the end, it was the outsider Su Zui who had the most time to accompany Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
Today, Su Zui was sitting besides the hospital bed and accompanying the injuried arm boss. Because he was bored, he grabbed an apple and started peeling it.
<br/><br/>
As he peeled, he pretended in his heart that he was pricking needles into the female lead voodoo doll.
<br/><br/>
This time, he was really angry.
<br/><br/>
Even if he and Fu Shijun didn’t treat the female lead well, none of them had thought of harming her life<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->.
<br/><br/>
The most they did was to let Su Zhimo take responsibility of the stuff she had done.
<br/><br/>
The law was fair. It was originally a matter of course.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zhimo?
<br/><br/>
Not only was she not resigned after being caught courting disaster, she also did this type of disgusting retaliation! 
<br/><br/>
He take care to not overdo things to other people but that’s only when the “other people” have some self-awareness.
<br/><br/>
To him, this was only a mission. Death was only data. If he died, he can redo it. But to Fu Shijun, who was a character within the plot, death was a real existence. 
<br/><br/>
To the people within this book, this imaginary and preposterous book world was reality.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun looked at him. He wanted to say something but stopped himself. After stopping himself, he wanted to say something again. In the end, he still tactfully reminded Su Zui: “Xiao Zui, be careful to not cut your hand.”
<br/><br/>
The originally fist sized apple had already been reduced to half its size by Su Zui within a few minutes.
<br/><br/>
If he didn’t know any better, he could have thought that Su Zui was cutting the brain of his enemy.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
He really doesn't know what grudge Su Zui has against it.
<br/><br/>
It was only then that Su Zui gave an “oh” and cut the remaining apple into separate pieces. He put them on a plate and allowed Fu Shijun to used his good hand to eat.
<br/><br/>
To speak truthfully, this apple wasn’t that sweet. However Fu Shijun ate it piece by piece until all the apples were finished. His heart was filled with content.
<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijun finished eating, Su Zui grabbed a wet napping to help him wipe his hands but was taken advantage by the other and his fingers were grabbed.
<br/><br/>
Just as he was about to remove his hand, Fu Shijun suddenly opened his mouth: “That day when I drank your milk tea......did you get angry? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to intentionally offend you.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui considered the pros and cons for a moment before silently putting down the knife in his hand. He decided to let the boss’s small claws flutter around outside for a couple days.
<br/><br/>
When Fu Shijun’s arm gets better, he’ll chop it off.
<br/><br/>
He raised his eyebrow: “Why are you still taking note of it? I have already forgotten. At this time, you don’t need to worry about those small matters. Just focus on recovery.”
<br/><br/>
He pulled his fingers out of Fu Shijun’s hands. He lightly raised the corner of his lips and coaxed him: “When you get out of the hospital, I can treat you to milk tea for a month. You don’t need to keep thinking about that mouthful.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun stared at him for a moment. When he saw that Su Zui really didn’t mind, he gave a light “en”.
<br/><br/>
When he let out a breath of relief, he also felt faintly disappointed.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
How can he......not mind a single bit?
<br/><br/>
After finish feeding the boss fruit, Su Zui turned on the laptop and let Fu Shijun handle his company matters.
<br/><br/>
Even if the bone in the arm was broken, Fu Shijun was still the leader of a conglomerate. It wasn’t possible for Fu Shijun to give himself a long vacation.
<br/><br/>
The secondary matters can be given to the subordinates to handle, but there will always be some matter that requires him to personally deal with.
<br/><br/>
Even if he is lying on a hospital bed, the things that should be done still needs to be done.
<br/><br/>
But it wasn’t convenient for Fu Shijun to type with a single hand so all the work that required typing was done by Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
“This part needs to be marked and have it fixed by them......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui typed for the other person but didn’t have a bit of complaint.
<br/><br/>
In this situation, it wasn’t as if he wasn’t receiving any benefits.
<br/><br/>
By personally participating in Fu Shijun’s thought process as he handle work, he was able to become aware which part of his own work was inadequate.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
When Su Zui ran into matters that he couldn’t understand, he would stop and asked Fu Shijun for guidance. Fu Shijun was very happy to teach him. His explanations were full of patience.
<br/><br/>
Among the two, one asked while the other answered. Both were deeply immersed in their work. The atmosphere was extremely proper.
<br/><br/>
But without knowing why, even though it was clearly a proper image, Fu Shijing, who had rushed to come visit his brother, stood outside the patient door and felt that if he entered at this time, he will become a big thousand kilowatt lightbulb and make the entire patient room well-lit.
<br/><br/>

								<br/><br/> <a href = "#footnote1top" id = "footnote1bottom">1</a>: This isn’t a real dove. The part of the sentence was “苏醉就鸽了公司那边” and the “鸽了” (the dove part) meant that he was being dishonest about his reasoning. 
								In this context, it basically meant that he told the company he is going on “vacation” but went to accompany and work with Fu Shijun instead. Another example where you dove someone is calling in sick for work but in reality, they are playing games at home ^-^;;;
