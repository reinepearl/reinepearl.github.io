								Assistant Su, sorry to trouble you. Please give this document to President Fu. After President Fu finished looking over it, you can give it to the finance department.”
<br/><br/>
When Su Zui exited the restroom, he met a tall, indifferent face female assistant coming out from the elevator.
<br/><br/>
When that assistant happened to see him pass by, she passed over the documents in her hand to him.
　　<br/><br/>
“Ok. I will.”
<br/><br/>
He gave a word of thanks, received the documents, and knocked on the CEO’s door before bringing the documents in.
<br/><br/>
From the start, he didn’t notice that there was a delicate looking assistant biting her lips behind him and giving him a peculiar look towards his back.
　　<br/><br/>
“Sister Zhao,” Xu Yanyan hesitated for a moment before yelling to stop tall assistant walking away. In a wronged voice, she said: “Before, it was always me who gave President Fu those documents......”
<br/><br/>
That assistant who Xu Yanyan called Sister Zhao gave her a glance and pretended she wasn’t able to hear the meaning behind her words. In an indifferent voice, she said: “He was passing by. It’s the same no matter who gives it to President Fu.”
　　<br/><br/>
She didn’t tell the truth to Xu Yanyan.
<br/><br/>
It wasn’t because Su Zui was passing by. Rather, it was because she wanted to give Su Zui be on his good side.
<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui wasn’t one of the people in their company, but their CEO was close enough to the other to bring them by their side to teach them. By giving helping Su Zui, it will definitely not bring any trouble.
　　<br/><br/>
Only, while she knows about Su Zui’s identity, Xu Yanyan, who was also an assistant like her, does not know.
<br/><br/>
While Su Zui did not intentionally disguise the face that he is the Qin Family’s successor, he didn’t outright proclaim it either.
<br/><br/>
That’s why, there are actually a lot of people who didn’t know Su Zui was actually coming to study and thought that he had entered through the backdoor to become an assistant.
　　<br/><br/>
With how half-hearted her answer was, Xu Yanyan was naturally able to hear it and immediately felt dissatisfied.
<br/><br/>
How could it be the same?!
<br/><br/>
But Assistant Zhao’s position was higher than hers. She didn’t dare express her unease towards Assistant Zhao, so in a blink of an eye, she lightly said with some complaint: “That new person doesn’t understand stuff too well. He doesn’t even know to let senior——”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing this, Assistant Zhao’s original indifferent expression became ugly. In a stern voice, she interrupted her: “That’s enough! Why are you talking bad about someone during work? If the boss hears you, do you still think you can work?”
　　<br/><br/>
While she knows about Assistant Su’s identity, she doesn’t plan to telling Xu Yanyan.
<br/><br/>
Why could she give Xu Yanyan this grace? Won’t it just be a waste of time explaining it?
<br/><br/>
Besides, the CEO doesn’t like people who shoot their mouths off.
　　<br/><br/>
Assistant Zhao’s manner was very strong. After being scolded a few sentences, Xu Yanyan couldn’t hold it out and the corners of her eyes turned red.
<br/><br/>
Her appearance looked delicate and soft. When she showed a wronged expression, the pitiful expression made people can’t help but sympathize with her.
　　<br/><br/>
But they are all woman. Assistant Zhao didn’t eat this set and turned and walked away without a change in expression.
<br/><br/>
When President Fu works, he doesn’t recognize the difference between men or women. Rather, he treated everyone the same. Even women were ordered to work like animals. She really doesn’t know what’s the use of Xu Yanyan acting everyday.
　　<br/><br/>
Except she still felt a weak partnership from working together. In the end, her heart still became soft and turned her head around to remind her: “It’s fine as long as you do your work. Don’t bother with other stuff and also don’t think too much.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was a prince who was following around their boss to study. With his identity, he should have made more appearances. However, he will leave after two months. This didn’t hinder them at all.
　　<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan waited until she left before burying her head on the desktop and a few tears fell.
　　<br/><br/>
Because the Fu Corporation was such a big conglomerate, the number of CEO assistants were all set and everyone’s work was clear-cut.
<br/><br/>
If they were important, they will be handling official business for the CEO. By being the CEO’s right hand man, they were able to give orders regarding company matters. Their wage was also high enough to scare people.
<br/><br/>
In theory, they are assistants, but in reality, they weren’t any different from a department director. So much that because they are “a member of the emperor’s circle”, the matters that they come in contact with are all inside information.
<br/><br/>
Assistant Zhao, who just passed over the documents to Su Zui, was a part of that circle.
　　<br/><br/>
There were also those like her. Their work didn’t need any special skills. Most of the time, besides answering phone calls, they would hand over documents. It was a job that anyone could do.
<br/><br/>
So when she saw Su Zui doing the work that originally belonged to her, even if it was done offhandedly, it was especially troubling.
　　<br/><br/>
The wage from her job wasn’t high. The only perk was that her opportunity to see the CEO was higher than most. If even that perk wasn’t available anymore, then what was the meaning of her being an assistant?
<br/><br/>
She leaned on the desk for a long while, but not a single person came to comfort her. After half a day, she could only raise her head in despair.
<br/><br/>
Someone saw Xu Yanyan finally raised her head and can’t resist coming over and giving her a wink.
<br/><br/>
Everybody was here to see the boss’s face. Although there were some stuff that they didn’t understand, but they wouldn’t so casually show their complaint.
<br/><br/>
After all, the smart people knew that the stupid die due to their talkative behavior. 
　　<br/><br/>
As for whether Su Zui knew about Xu Yanyan’s thoughts?
<br/><br/>
With his EQ, just by thinking about if offhandedly, he could naturally knew about it.
<br/><br/>
But it wasn't necessary for him to pay attention to the mood of these nobody, so he simply didn’t think about it.
　　<br/><br/>
He was very busy.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s injury was on his frequently used right arm. Except for signatures that needed Fu Shijun to personally sign, looking over documents, annotating documents, and replying to emails......this were all done by him.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had lived in the hospital for a week. Although he had done work intermittently in his hospital bed, but there was still plenty of piled up work.
　　<br/><br/>
Being Fu Shijun’s assistant on the first day, Su Zui was so busy he didn’t have any time to relax.
<br/><br/>
So much that outside of work, he hasn’t spoken to Fu Shijun.
　　<br/><br/>
“Can I write it like this?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui said as he passed his annotated document towards Fu Shijun.
　　<br/><br/>
Because he was ghostwriting for Fu Shijun, he had to bend his waist while standing next to Fu Shijun. The distance was very close. Because he was benting, the arc of his back was extremely obvious and was generously displayed in front of Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
In this close distance, even if it was blocked by a rigid suit, he could still see that tight and narrow curve line of Su Zui’s back. It made people can’t help but extend their hand and stroke it from the very top of his spine and to the waist before reaching the tailbone.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s gaze can’t help but fall on that slender waist outlined by the suit. As if his eyes were glued by something, he was unable to move his gaze away.
　　<br/><br/>
“En. Is there a problem?” Seeing how Fu Shijun haven’t responded, Su Zui voiced his doubt.
<br/><br/>
This was the “homework” that Fu Shijun had arranged for him to let him polish himself.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun hurriedly move his gaze away. His expression had a scantily undetectable panic: “Let me see.”
<br/><br/>
He did his best to push down the rising heat from his ears and grabbed the document: “......This is fine. The reasoning are all proper. You have done well.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......” 
<br/><br/>
He pretended to not see Fu Shijun’s red earlobe as he calmly said: “Then that’s good.”
　　<br/><br/>
He put down the documents and directly asked Fu Shijun: “Is your arm still hurting?”
　　<br/><br/>
After just getting out of the hospital, it was impossible for it to not hurt.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had wanted to show off and say it doesn’t hurt, but after remembering how Su Zui would wrinkle his eyebrow every single time he pretended to be strong, he hesitated before changing his mind: “Only a little bit.”
<br/><br/>
His gaze fell to Su Zui’s waist once again, but this time, he didn’t have any messy thoughts: “Didn’t I give you a chair? Why are you still standing? Is your waist sore?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui flipped through the document and offhandly said: “It’s nothing. I’m not tired.”
<br/><br/>
He was an assistant. How could he sit and do work on the CEO’s desk?
<br/><br/>
That will overstep the boundaries too much. He knows Fu Shijun doesn’t mind but if he were seen by subordinates like that, it will be difficult to prevent them from gossiping.
<br/><br/>
It was better to avoid unnecessary trouble. After he used the Constitution Strengthening Reagent on himself, his body was already a lot better. Even if he were to stand for a whole day, he wouldn’t be tired.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun wrinkled his eyebrows: “No. If you are going to stand, I’ll stand with you.”
<br/><br/>
When he brought the other by his side, it wasn’t because he wanted to play dirty tricks on him.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui couldn’t let an invalid person stand with him for a whole day and can only compromise: “Ok.”
<br/><br/>
He compromised by switching the chair with a small desk and also moved the small desk towards the narrow empty space by Fu Shijun’s side. This look has a similar meaning to how one could move their small seat to do work for another.
<br/><br/>
But even so, this didn’t prevent other people from talking.
<br/><br/>
When Xu Yanyan came in to deliver documents, she took a glance at Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
After putting the documents down, she didn’t immediately leave. Instead, she turned her head to look at Su Zui and gave him a warm and beautiful smile. In a very low voice and considerate tone, she suggested: “If Assistant Su doesn’t have anywhere to sit, you can go outside to the assistant area. That area has a lot of empty desks. I have already helped you tidy it up.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui raised his head from looking over the documents and looked at Xu Yanyan’s delicate face, and raised his eyebrow.
<br/><br/>
He wasn’t angry from her words. He was simply curious. With this EQ and accomplishments......how did she became a CEO assistant?
　　<br/><br/>
When he declining Fu Shijun just now, it was because he was considering their friendship. This was a matter between the two of them. This person......the lowest assistant who only does miscellaneous task. Just where did she get the self confidence and believe that she can override her boss’s decision?
　　<br/><br/>
As if he thought this was too funny, even the corner of his lips turned up.
<br/><br/>
After he finished laughing, he lowered his head and looked over the documents. From the start, he didn’t acknowledge a single one of Xu Yanyan’s words.
　　<br/><br/>
Because she thought Su Zui was being indifferent and disdainful, her gentle face became rigid and she bit her lips while feeling wrong. She quietly said: “Assistant Su, I’m doing this for you......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun became stunned by Su Zui’s brief smile for a moment, before his gaze turned to this neat and pitiful looking assistant. His eyebrows wrinkled.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face was expressionless but the anger in his heart was already ready to burst: “What is your name? ......Forget it. You don’t need to tell me. You can let Assistant Zhao take you to Human Resources to transfer you to another position. Anywhere is fine. Don’t let me see you again.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan’s eyes became big with a stupefied expression.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was not talkative normally. Even during work hours, if he could use a few words to deal with a matter, he would definitely not add extra words.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Xu Yanyan frequently sees him due to exchanging documents, but most of the time, not even three sentences were said to her in a day.
<br/><br/>
Occurrences like today, where he spoke to her in several long sentences, were practically a miracle that only happens in a hundred year.
<br/><br/>
Normally, she could have feel pleasantly surprised and fully content with her achievements, and even feel like floating as she walked.
　　<br/><br/>
But right now, she didn’t feel a single bit of joy from the experience. Instead, she felt absolute terror.
<br/><br/>
Her face was deathly pale as paper. She didn’t understand how a single suggestion from her could cause her to lose this powerful CEO assistant position: “President Fu, hear me out. I, I......”
　　<br/><br/>

								In this context, it basically meant that he told the company he is going on “vacation” but went to accompany and work with Fu Shijun instead. Another example where you dove someone is calling in sick for work but in reality, they are playing games at home ^-^;;;
