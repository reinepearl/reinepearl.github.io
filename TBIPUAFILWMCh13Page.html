								Yang Yuanhang’s tragic and emotional expression suddenly became a bit distorted after hearing these words.
<br/><br/>
Before he came, he had thought up plenty of Su Zui’s reactions.
<br/><br/>
Maybe it was because the joyful surprise was mixed with horror, or maybe it was the shock and frustration.
<br/><br/>
The only scenario he had not imagined was this. With only a few sentences, the tides have turned and his confession turned to self delusion.
　　<br/><br/>
Under the moonlight, the youth seemed to got over the surprise. His expression also became indifferent.
<br/><br/>
His back was thin, but he stood as straight as a pen. Like a small jade bamboo, he stood there with a light and thin body, but doesn’t break no matter the pressure exerted.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s heart suddenly became numb.
<br/><br/>
He had originally acted out his affections ninety percent of the time, but when Su Zui’s words lightly float out, the immediate anger was thirty percent real!
<br/><br/>
He bit his teeth and looked at Su Zui: “Xiao Zui, how can you talk about our feelings like that? Did you forget the words you said when you first chased me? Were those all lies?”
<br/><br/>
What jokes!
<br/><br/>
At that time, it was clearly Su Zui who didn’t care about anything and eagerly chased him. Yet now, it suddenly became self delusion?
　　<br/><br/>
When had Su Zui start becoming such a two face?!
<br/><br/>
Su Zui exposed a helpless expression: “Mr. Yang, I had already said: If you have an illness, you should get it treated as soon as possible. While I don’t understand why you insist that there’s an ambiguous relationship between us, but I hope that you will immediately stop these slander. Or else, I can guarantee that I will act on my right to take you to court for slandering my name.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang could not believe this. He stared at Su Zui for half a day and his hoarse voice was harsh to the ears: “Good, now it isn’t you who is begging me to stay together with you for a bit longer——“
<br/><br/>
“Where are the bodyguards?” A low deep male voice cut him off.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s expression was cold and serious: “Did you come to work to watch a scene? When are you prepared to stop watching?”
　　　　<br/><br/>
The bodyguards, who had been silent as a chicken standing at one side, suddenly came over. They all charged in and restrained Yang Yuanhang and Mother Yang.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang had wanted to fight back, but Qin Family’s bodyguards were all professionally trained. Seeing him struggle, they unhesitatingly stepped on the bent of his legs and make him kneel down.
　　<br/><br/>
How could Yang Yuanhang be capable of fighting back when he was a thin and weak scholar who sit in front of the canvas the whole day?
<br/><br/>
Very quickly, his arms were pinched together. His whole person was pressed down on the ground in an incomparably humiliating position.
　　<br/><br/>
Because his knee tendons were ruthlessly kicked, the pain caused his vision to go black. He was unable to continue acting and his mouth continued to let out painful noises.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing her son pressed down so harshly by other people, Mother Yang immediately screeched: “AH——MURDER! MURDER! JUST WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HURRY UP AND LET GO OF MY SON!”
　　<br/><br/>
She charged as she spoke, as if she was going to slap the bodyguards like she usually does with her son.
<br/><br/>
But being a boorish farm wife, even if her strength was stronger than normal, how could she win against professionals when they really fight?
<br/><br/>
Shortly after, she was also restrained to the ground with Yang Yuanhang.
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang’s body constitution was way better than Yang Yuanhang’s, and still has the strength to cry out: “You rich people oppress people! What did us mother and son do to deserve this horrible treatment? God! If Yuanhang received any harm today, I’ll die by hanging myself right in front of your doorsteps!”
<br/><br/>
She raised her head and used her tearful eyes to stare dead at Su Zui: “Su Zui, didn’t you like Yuanhang? This is your love? Quickly tell this people to let us go!”
　　<br/><br/>
Without waiting Su Zui’s reply, Fu Shijun had already walked a few steps forward and used his body to block Mother Yang’s unpleasant gaze.
<br/><br/>
He used his deep voice to comfort the youth behind his back: “Don’t mind them.”　　
<br/><br/>
Su Zui blinked his eyes: “......I didn’t take it to heart.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “En.”
<br/><br/>
When he heard Su Zui denying his relationship with Yang Yuanhang just now, he had been relieved.
<br/><br/>
He already said before——such an astute smart looking small friend, how can he be so blind to fall in love with Yang Yuanhang?
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun turned to look at Grandfather Qin: “Uncle Qin, I originally shouldn’t be the one to say this.”
<br/><br/>
He glanced at Yang Yuanhang, who was pathetically kneeling on the ground, and said: “When I sent Xiao Zui back previously, I saw this person before.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin was a bit shocked: “You saw him before?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nodded: “At that time, I felt that this person did something to Xiao Zui, so I did some private investigations and found that this person was inferior and constantly lie.”
<br/><br/>
He continued: “This person is called Yang Yuanhang. Not only did he conduct malpractices in high school, but he had also plagiarized his classmates’ art work during college. After college, he lied to took advantage of Xiao Zui and used his subsidiaries to play around everyday and was frequently together with different men.
　　<br/><br/>
“Xiao Zui had no idea about any of these. I was considering how to warn Xiao Zui just now. Who could have known that he could have come to the doorstep himself and splash dirty water on Xiao Zui.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin became pale from shock: “Was what you said really true?”
<br/><br/>
In actuality, his heart already believed him by eighty percent.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was a trustworthy person. The words from his mouth had a high degree of believability.
<br/><br/>
In addition, being the CEO of a corporation, he had no reason to target the inferior Yang Yuanhang.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun nodded: “If you are still worried, I can send the material to you.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin: “There’s no need. Uncle still believes in your words.”
　　<br/><br/>
He looked at the crying mother and the moaning son and his face became dark: “While my Qin Family is usually kind with others, but we will not be freely taken advantage of by others. Bodyguards, immediately throw these two out.”
<br/><br/>
“This time, I won’t dispute against you. But if you let me see you again in the future, don’t think I will let you off easily!”
　　<br/><br/>
While Grandfather Qin was old, but he had still lived in the business world for most of his life. Once he stood up and showed his strength, it can really make people feel cold.
　　<br/><br/>
When had the mother and son pair ever seen such a thing?
<br/><br/>
For a while, both of them were scared to the point they didn’t dare to make a sound, like a duck who’s neck has been pinched.
　　<br/><br/>
After he finished dealing with the two people, Grandfather Qin turned his head to look at Su Zui and sighed: “Yesterday, I had still praised you for being smart. Today, how did you get lied to so badly by others? I’m an old person, but I still helped you clean up this mess.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui innocently blinked: “I——“
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun immediately cut in: “Don’t blame him. He’s still young and doesn’t have any social experience. Being lied to is very normal. In the future, after he gained more experience, he will naturally be able to tell.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
Seeing how boss was protecting him like he was a child, if he didn’t know the plot, he could have doubt whether or not he was the boss’s illegitimate child!
<br/><br/>
He rolled his eyes and took in Fu Shijun’s tall body that was blocking his view, and could not understand him.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing how the mother and son pair was about to be thrown out, Su Zui suddenly opened his mouth: “Wait a moment, I have a few things I need to say to Mr. Yang.”
<br/><br/>
The originally dead looking Yang Yuanhang’s eyes immediately rose with hope with he head these words: “Xiao Zui, I……”
　　<br/><br/>
Yet, Su Zui ruthlessly destroyed his last hope: “While I don’t understand why you could come to my house and cause a ruckus, but I need to regretfully tell you that I am going to stop subsidizing you. Please move out of the villa within three days and don’t try to find me ever again.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang only felt that there thunder blasting off in his ears.
<br/><br/>
Before he came, he had thought that Su Zui may be angry but he never thought that Su Zui could directly break up with him!
<br/><br/>
Ever since they start having disagreements, wasn’t it always Su Zui who carefully cater to him and begged him to not break up?
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang couldn’t understand no matter what. How could a person change so drastically in just a short half a month?
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang finally felt terrified and he said incoherently: “No, no. Xiao Zui, you have to listen to me. I cannot not have you……”
<br/><br/>
He was already used to the luxurious life and have seen the extravagance of the higher class.
<br/><br/>
In the future, if he didn’t have Su Zui’s subsidiary, he has no idea how he will be able to live.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s eyes flashed, as if he was really regretful, and said: “Mr. Yang, I had really appreciated your talent. If it wasn’t for the things today, I was originally going to keep subsidizing you. It’s really too bad…….”
<br/><br/>
——If it wasn’t for today.
<br/><br/>
——If wasn’t for him listening to that woman’s words.
<br/><br/>
A went sound and Yang Yuanhang’s last strand of rationale was broken by Su Zui’s provocation.
　　<br/><br/>
Like he was grabbing some life saving medicine, he stared at Su Zhimo, who was hidden behind the crowd, and in a hoarse voice, he shouted: “It was Su Zhimo! It was her who told me to do this! It, it was her who wants to strangle you to death! The only reason I did this was because she lied to me! I know my mistake…...Xiao Zui, don’t leave me!”
　　<br/><br/>
Once these words were said, the whole scene became silent.
<br/><br/>
Everyone’s gaze was indescribable as they looked at Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
Especially Grandfather Qin and Fu Shijun. When they looked at Su Zhimo, their eyes seemed to freeze over.
　　<br/><br/>
Met with this situation, the uncles that were praising how talented Su Zhimo was just now all moved away from her.
<br/><br/>
They don’t mind working together with Su Zhimo to attack Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
But seeing how Su Zhimo was about to be in trouble, it’s still better for them to not involve themselves for no reason!
　　<br/><br/>
Even Su Chengzhi, who had always spoiled Su Zhimo, didn’t dare to stand up for his daughter under Grandfather Qin and Fu Shijun’s pressure, and can only silently be bold in his heart.
　　<br/><br/>
The person standing in between Su Zhimo and Yang Yuanhang dodged to the side as if there were something chasing after him.
<br/><br/>
With this, Su Zhimo was forced to meet Yang Yuanhang’s gaze and was unable to avoid it even if she tried.
　　<br/><br/>
Suddenly becoming the center of attention, Su Zhimo was angry to the point of coughing out blood. She had never imagined that Yang Yuanhang could dare to bite her at this time!
<br/><br/>
By outing her right now, except for both of them suffering together, what other benefit was there?
<br/><br/>
A single person is more harmful than ten enemies. This saying exactly represents Yang Yuanhang, this brainless pig teammate!
　　<br/><br/>
Her heart was full of anger, but her face didn’t show any hint just like before. Her voice was clear and cold; she raised her chin and said: “Mr. Yang, what do you mean by this? I have no recognition of you. Please do not casually pull other people to carry your blame just because you want to be relieved of your crime.”
　　<br/><br/>
She attempted to remind Yang Yuanhang, but Yang Yuanhang, who had already lost his rationality, was completely unable to read her hint.
<br/><br/>
Hearing her denial, his heart became more angry and frustrated: “You cheap bastard! Being a prostitute yet acting all proper! Hey, let me tell you! If I’m going down, don’t think you will get away cleanly!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was used to receiving other people’s praises especially from the opposite sex. When had she been cursed this badly in front of so many people?
<br/><br/>
What was worse was that there wasn’t anyone on the scene that was willing to help her. She also can’t not maintain her image and curse back, so she could only endure it!
<br/><br/>
In almost an instant, her clear cold face was unmaintainable.
