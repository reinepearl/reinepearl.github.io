								<p id = "contentParagraph">Summer Solstice has not yet passed. And this was already the fourth time this year.
<br/><br/>The goddess glanced down at the trembling mortal before her.
<br/><br/>The poor child. It was a shame she would never see her eighteenth summer. What a shame. A young lady with a prosperous background, known for both beauty and literary talents is currently in such a condition.
<br/><br/>The goddess’s blatant appraisal was too much for a mere mortal. The girl’s dainty frame collapsed under the weight of pitiful sobs, tears streamed down her youthful cheeks. 
<br/><br/>How beautiful. What a shame that she was caught by Zeus.
<br/><br/>The girl plastered her body to the ground. Wishing the fields would take pity on her, swallow her as it did another beauty long ago.
<br/><br/>Hera’s lips curled at the thought. That would never happen. A certain brother of hers is quite the devoted husband. No matter. The girl would soon enter his kingdom. </p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">The King of Olympus is indeed a twisted character.
<br/><br/>Hera knew the man she called her husband. She knows that despite popular opinion, Zeus was no fool.
<br/><br/>Zeus knows of her hatred for infidelity. Knows that her will not—cannot—let such betrayals go unpunished.
<br/><br/>Zeus also knows that Hera will never defeat him in battle. The King knows his wife's character. And the Queen is a practical woman.
<br/><br/>Hera glided across the white marble floor and sat at the ivory vanity. She knew of Zeus’s despicable ways long before his proposal, but he had never flaunted his affairs before. His previous wives were never so blatantly disrespected. As she gently played with the curls that fell down her shoulders, Hera deduced that she herself was the only variable.
<br/><br/>The Goddess of Marriage and Family must retaliate somehow, but her attacks can never reach him.
<br/><br/>In the beginnings of their marriage, she often wondered if his acts of disrespect were merely schemes to rid of certain women. Perhaps their families disrespected him. Perhaps the women had some quality that irritated him.
<br/><br/>A few decades of their union provided more than enough evidence for her to reject that hypothesis. Zeus was someone who preferred to punish any offense personally. He liked everyone knowing the gory details--the gorier the better.
<br/><br/>And so, Hera concluded that the King was merely a pervert.
<br/><br/>Why else would he purposely bring about retribution to those he favored? Unless Zeus just had a thing for seeing beautiful young women and men tortured.
<br/><br/>An unqueenly snort echoed throughout the main bedchambers.
<br/><br/>That would still make him a pervert.
<br/><br/>Hera was confident in her performance as the Queen of the Gods. There was nothing to complain about in regards to her role as Queen. She was born to rule. She knew that the moment she opened her eyes and saw the interior of her dear father’s stomach. Power. Reputation. Above all else, these two things belong to her. 
<br/><br/>There was one thing Hera knew for certain: Zeus has been deliberately picking fights with her. Hera would never vouch for her husband’s wisdom—or even sanity. (After all, he is the one who’s been proactively trying to provoke her since the first day of their marriage.) But Hera was willing to admit—albeit begrudgingly—that he’s got a decent head on those brawny bronze shoulders. If he truly wanted to committed adultery due to uncontrollable lust, Zeus could easily hide his traces. Hera ruled out the King's arrogance as the culprit for his carelessness. The evidence was too subtle yet easily noticeable to be anything other than intentionally planted.
<br/><br/>She was no Athena—she has it in her to (begrudgingly) admit that the stoic little girl is truly a god among gods. Still, Queen fancied herself a sensible woman with a decent mind of her own. Zeus was more than aware of her capabilities. Hence his proposal.
<br/><br/>Which is precisely why the Goddess of Marriage and Family would give almost anything to know why her husband chooses to tarnish her reputation so. The King's behavior is utterly illogical! After all, the pair are partners. Hera was sorely tempted to ask him, and even came close to indulging her curiosity several times. But she refrained.
<br/><br/>Relationships come in many forms. Theirs was a one of practicality.
<br/><br/>The thought of discussing matters beyond the state with Zeus.... It left her oddly uncomfortable. It was best to maintain proper boundaries.
<br/><br/>Hera had the ability to help him rule Olympus, and Zeus had the ability to give her the authority she lacked—that she craved. Being Zeus's fourth wife, Hera could have been his fortieth wife for all she cared. A fond smile sneaked across Hera's lips as she recalled how she had collapsed from exhaustion after the first court. She had resolved a pressing situation regard the barrier between the realms. Mother Gaia did she love every second of being Zeus’s queen.
<br/><br/>Being Zeus’s wife, however, was more difficult. Nothing seems to satisfy the god. They’ve been married for so long, yet Hera still hasn’t a clue want he truly wants from her.
<br/><br/>The god she married enjoys infuriating her; she, in return, relishes in retaliation. Not exactly the model-marriage she was going for.
<br/><br/>Sometimes, she wonders how it would have been to have married Hades instead, only to shudder at the thought. Ew.
<br/><br/>Hades is her closest friends and brother. They grew up together. It was difficult and undoubtedly strange to think of him in any other way.
<br/><br/>The grimace in the mirror reflected the goddess' horror. Her hair was now slightly tousled from shaking head in disgust.
<br/><br/>In any case, the King’s reason for provoking her was not something that the Queen particularly needed to know. It is unlikely he would change. If the powerful goddess' previous creative punishments failed to deter him, nothing will. Oddly, Zeus seems more motivated as her fury escalates. Stopping Zeus from insulting her title is akin to Sisyphus’s task. A sensible woman does not fight to lose. And Hera is nothing if not sensible.
<br/><br/>Yet, as the Goddess of Marriage and Family, Hera cannot let acts of betrayal go unpunished. Despite herself, Hera felt a surge of familiar red. Pale cheeks flushed with heat.
<br/><br/>Whatever the King's reasons are, they are his own. What does matter is his mockery. Such insolence! Hera’s reflection eyes glinted with anger. Her fist met the vanity with a slight bang. Enough was enough. The Goddess of Marriage and Family will never be insulted in such a way again. The Queen will never be humiliated in her own palace ever again.
<br/><br/>It is clearly not enough to exact vengeance upon those weak enough to be seduced by the sky god. To be fair, it’s almost unnecessary. Zeus rarely cares for any of his lovers, only intervening when her vengeance strikes his children. And even then, her husband is selective about which of his bastards to protect.
<br/><br/>She cannot hope to match him in terms physical strength. But Zeus cannot hope to match her in terms of influence. Hera has many more devout followers who actually pray to her and rely on her—men and women both. She is the patroness of marriage and family. Both areas painfully concrete in daily life. Lord of rain and sky? Perhaps relevant during planting season. Hera rolled her eyes. Knowing Zeus, he probably chose that title as a display of strength.
<br/><br/>Her dear king has been inviting her to participate in his senseless battle time and time again. Who was she to deny her husband of the pleasure?
<br/><br/>A rare smile spread across the Queen Goddess’ lips.</p>

<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">Stories of Zeus's incompetence circulates. It soon becomes widely believed among mortals that Zeus is the most powerful god, yet is incredibly incompetent at managing state affairs. He, according to rumors, lacks wisdom and intelligence, preferring to spend all his time chasing after the next pretty thing he sees.
<br/><br/>Later, it becomes common knowledge that Olympus would have long fallen were it not for Queen Hera, Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, and Apollo. Even Hades seem to have played a more prominent role in managing godly affairs that the King of All Gods.
<br/><br/>As widely circulated as it is, tales of Zeus’s incompetence reached Lower Olympus. It was only a matter of time before the Central realm gets busy.
<br/><br/>Hera was more than satisfied as she admired the scenery. Dark clouds and lightning. How beautiful. What a shame that she’ll soon have to share this view with someone less pleasant.
