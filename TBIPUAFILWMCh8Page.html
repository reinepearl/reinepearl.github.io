								<strong>This chapter contains some homophobic behavior. </strong>
<br/><br/>
A “ka da” sounded and the back door’s lock opened.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui kept his hands on the steering wheel: “Brother Yang, you should get down now.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s eyes wouldn’t help but fall on his hands. That pair of hands were slim and slender. When the hands are on the dark colored steering wheel, the light cyan colored veins at the back of the hands were very apparent.
<br/><br/>
He stared blankly for a moment, before snapping out of it: “You aren’t coming in?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui replied: “No, it’s ok. There are still a lot of work that needs to be done. I need to go home and work overtime.”
　　<br/><br/>
The words “go home” made Yang Yuanhang’s heart suddenly feel uncomfortable.
<br/><br/>
He remembered when he first moved into this small villa.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was like a diligent honeybee and helped him move his stuff in high spirits. His body was full of sweat, but he still excitedly threw himself towards him. 
<br/><br/>
He bent his eyes like a crescent moon, hung on his shoulders, and swayed around: “Brother Yang, this is our home from now on.”
<br/><br/>
After half a day, he drooped down his eyes, his voice also lowered, and his eyes were full of yearning: “After my father married my stepmother, my grandfather’s family no longer have a position for me. Brother Yang, I only have you now.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yet now, standing in front of this villa, Su Zui was telling him this type of “go home” words.
<br/><br/>
His expression was calm, as if he was asking him if he had eaten.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang can only feel himself choking with anger, unable to release it but also unable to swallow it.
<br/><br/>
Wanting to say something but stopping midway, in the end, he can only dryly choke out: “Then you should go do your work.”
　　<br/><br/>
Before, if there wasn’t anything to do, Su Zi simply wished he would stayed with him in the villa, not leaving for one second.
<br/><br/>
He had always felt that the youth was too annoying this way, and had always want Su Zui to go away. 
<br/><br/>
But now that Su Zui really gradually began to put importance onto other things, and no longer focused his attention on him, his heart suddenly bubbled with anger and anxiousness, like a tide that will swallow him up.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang got down from the car but wasn’t in a hurry to enter the villa. Instead, he stood there and single-mindedly watched the person in the car.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was also not in a hurry to drive away. He pressed on his cellphone twice and sat in the driver seat to talk with the other person.
<br/><br/>
The window’s soundproofing was very good. Yang Yuanhang can only watch the youth’s lip bend into a smile inside the car, as if he was very delighted, but couldn’t hear what he was saying.
　　<br/><br/>
“......Yes, just do it like that. Be careful, I rather you arrange more people than failing.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui hung up in a satisfied manner and threw the cellphone to one side. He gave Yang Yuanhang a warm harmless smile before stepping on the gas and drove away.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang still stood blankly in the original spot for quite a while, before returning to the villa.
</p>

“Bang!”
　　<br/><br/>
Early in the morning, Yang Yuanhang was awoken due to the noise of a heavy object falling onto the ground.
<br/><br/>
His opened his eyes while having a splitting headache.
<br/><br/>
His brain was as if something had been smashed, and can only remembered faint and scattered fragments.　　
<br/><br/>
A bar, a boy…..
<br/><br/>
The last thing he remembered was pressing down that person in bed.
　　<br/><br/>
Oh, that’s right. Yesterday, he was angered by Su Zui to the point his liver hurt, and was also choked to the point he felt unwell. Thus, he was unable to resist going to a bar he frequently went to before to drink some alcohol, find a boy that was nice to look at, and bring him back to sleep for a night.
　　<br/><br/>
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the shadow of an exposed arm. Yang Yuanhang propped himself up with the arm and prepared to get out of bed.
<br/><br/>
Maybe it was because of the hangover, after finishing this action, not only did he not feel any relief, but his brain also hurt as if it had been smashed.
　　<br/><br/>
He had just thought about washing his face to wake up more, yet as he raised his head, he was caught off-guard without any warning of a familiar figure standing by the door. The shadow of a middle-aged woman.
<br/><br/>
His mom.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang nearly thought he saw wrong, and it wasn’t until a few seconds later was he able to find his voice: “Mom? How can you be here?!”
　　<br/><br/>
Just as he finished speaking, he slowly remembered, a few days ago, his mom did say to him that she will visit come visit soon.
<br/><br/>
Except how can it be so sudden and arrive without a single greeting?
　　<br/><br/>
Suddenly remembering something, he fished out his cellphone from his coat. Sure enough, he found that his mom send him several text messages last night, saying she is already on the train and should be arriving in the morning.
<br/><br/>
At that time, he was still flirting with that boy to his heart’s content at the noisy bar, and completely didn’t notice his cellphone’s weak vibration.
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang picked up, and pointed at Yang Yuanhang in an unsatisfied manner: “You have the nerve to say this? How many texts have I sent you? You don’t even pick up the phone calls! I even thought it was because the connection wasn’t good! Good<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>! It turns out that you were fooling around with girls! If it weren’t for——AH!!”
<br/><br/>
Her sentence wasn’t finished before her eyes suddenly became wide, as if she saw something horrifying, and let out a screech that could practically break glass.
　　<br/><br/>
She looked at the flat chested and short hair boy at Yang Yuanhang’s side, and said incredulously: “Yuanhang! How can you be with a bo, boy<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a>, and do this type of abnormal stuff!!”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s brain was in disorder.
<br/><br/>
He used the blanket to cover up the boy next to him, put on clothes, and hurriedly got out of bed.
<br/><br/>
“Mom, you need to listen to my explanation!”
　　<br/><br/>
His hand that was pulling up his pants were shaking.
<br/><br/>
His parents were divorced. Because his father disliked the poor environment, he abandoned both mother and son and left.
<br/><br/>
It was only his mother that raised him.
<br/><br/>
His mom taught him from small that he needs to study well, stand out amongst his peers, marry a worthy and properly raised wife, and have children in order to become a proper and honorable child.
　　<br/><br/>
These ideologies were imbued into his brain day after day, and was already engraved into his bones, a non wipeable brand. 
<br/><br/>
When he discovered that he was more interested in male students than female students during puberty, his first reaction was horror.
<br/><br/>
His second reaction was that this matter definitely cannot be known to anyone else!
　　<br/><br/>
He had always hidden it very well. From middle school to high school, there wasn’t any relatives nor students that discovered anything abnormal.
<br/><br/>
In front of everyone’s eyes, he was always a first-rated student that was handsome and had good grades.
　　<br/><br/>
Until he tested into college and walked out of that secluded mountain village, did he dare to occasionally let loose in a city full of strangers.
<br/><br/>
But it was only merely like this.
<br/><br/>
When he hit the correct age, he will follow the prescribed order and find a suitable person to marry and have children.
　　<br/><br/>
In his life, he will definitely not walk the homosexual route and be jabbed in the spine and cursed to his bones by other people!
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang’s words pierced Yang Yuanhang’s heart letter by letter: “If you were to announce this, then how can your mom conduct myself? By that time, I will have to say I gave birth to an abnormality every single time I meet someone!”
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang spoke incoherently while shaking his head: “You won’t! Mom, I’m not an abnormality! Wait until I get marry and have children, then no one will say such things!”
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang picked up the bag that she dropped from shock, and charged and smashed Yang Yuanhang with anger: “I had endured all sorts of hardships to raise you up! It was all to let you bring honor to your ancestors! Not to let you be with a boy and do all these disgusting things!”
　　<br/><br/>
“Pa!”
<br/><br/>
Out of all the vegetables contained in that bag, Yang Yuanhang was coincidentally hit by a hard cabbage at the back of his head.
<br/><br/>
His brain was originally swollen as if it wants his life, now it hurts as if it has been split open.
<br/><br/>
He staggeredly away in an attempt to dodge but his body was still hit with several greens.
　　<br/><br/>
The boy was woken up by the noise and was terrified by this attitude. He watched this scene and curl back into the blankets, not daring to make any noise.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was ruggedly hit by his mom, and was also slapped a few times. Vegetable leaves hung from his head, and his whole figure became extremely sorry looking.
<br/><br/>
Suddenly, he remembered something. His heart suddenly burst with unease and he grabbed Mother Yang’s hand: “Mom, how did you get here?”
　　<br/><br/>
Mother Yang: “You still have the face to ask——”
<br/><br/>
She ruthlessly slapped Yang Yuanhang on the face again: “How did I get here? You were so busy doing these abnormal stuff! If it weren’t for your friend remembering to pick me up from the train station, I would have been sleeping on the streets!”
　　<br/><br/>
Friend?
<br/><br/>
The only friend that knows he was living here was——
　　<br/><br/>
A buzzing noise and Yang Yuanhang’s brain became numb.
<br/><br/>
Unable to continue explaining to his mother, he practically ran to the window as if he were to piss his pants and with his whole body in a mess, he pulled away the curtains and looked down.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was leaning on the car.
<br/><br/>
Spotted leaf shadows were cast onto his body, making him look incomparably beautiful.
<br/><br/>
Seeing him look over, Su Zui gave him an extremely warm smile.
　　<br/><br/>
[Ding! Main mission 1: Cannon fodder vengeance. Completion status: 40%]
<br/><br/>
[Novice’s early reward system had already transferred 1000 experience points to your account; please make sure it has been received!]
<br/><br/>
[Reminder: If the mission fails in the end, then the withdrawed money will be deducted from the next mission.]
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at the just added 1000 experience points in his account, then looked at Yang Yuanhang who had pieces of vegetable leaves hanging off his head, and his eyes carried a love that was indescribable to the system: “I didn’t understand the joy of raising pigs before, but now I understand. To personally raise a piglet to be fat before slaughtering it and cooking it, this has to be the world’s most delicious pig meat.”
<br/><br/>
System 555 failed to understand: “......The host wants to walk the farming route?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “I’m talking about Yang Yuanhang. Don’t you think this is similar to raising pigs?”
<br/><br/>
System 555: “......”
<br/><br/>
The host’s thought process really makes one’s head go bald!
　　<br/><br/>
To speak truthfully, if it wasn’t for the mission’s requirement to “let the scum gong obtain his desired retribution”, then he wouldn’t want to mix Yang Yuanhang’s mom into such low affairs.
<br/><br/>
But in the original plot, Yang Yuanhang used the bed photo to anger the original’s grandfather to death. If he wants to complete the main mission, then he needs to use similar tactics to retaliate. 
　　<br/><br/>
It’s good that Yang Yuanhang’s mom do farm work all year around. Her body was strong, not any worse than a man’s.
<br/><br/>
To be angered to the point it attacks the heart, yet not getting a heart attack nor fainting, but instead slapping Yang Yuanhang left and right to release her anger.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui cannot help but be a bit envious.
　　<br/><br/>
He also wants to slap Yang Yuanhang a few times, but he was unable to due to characterization and this body’s health.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui admired Yang Yuanhang’s expression with vegetable leaves hanging on his head for a while, before taking out his cellphone and giving him a call.
　　<br/><br/>
“Brother Yang,” He stared at Yang Yuanhang through the window: “I secretly went to the train station to pick up auntie. Don’t be angry.”
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang’s voice were a bit hoarse, and was actually trembling if one listens closely: “Su Zui, you——”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s light voice cut him off: “Don’t worry. I didn’t let auntie know about our relationship. I only said we were friends.”
<br/><br/>
His voice became deeper, and smiled in an embarrassed manner: “I only…...want to see auntie.”
　　<br/><br/>
After a while, Yang Yuanhang slowly said: “......In the future, talked to me first before doing this type of thing.”
<br/><br/>
The tone was clearly more relaxed.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui acted as if he didn’t notice it, and obediently nodded: “En. Then I’ll be leaving first. You should get along with auntie. If you aren’t busy, you should go take her out and buy some stuff.”
<br/><br/>
He paused for a moment, and suddenly asked: “Brother Yang. The green thing on top of your head, what is that?”
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang thought Su Zui will scold him for a split second: “......”
<br/><br/>
After half a day, he reached out his hand to touch his own brain. After touching a piece of the emerald green vegetable leaf, his whole face also became green.
<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang: “......My mom brought vegetable over. Just a moment ago, she wasn’t careful and dropped it. It’s nothing. You should hurry back. Be careful on the road.”
　　<br/><br/>
The boy he brought back yesterday was still curled up naked under the blanket.
<br/><br/>
If Su Zui detected anything abnormal and entered, he won’t be able to explain this no matter what.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s lips bend and said okay, before directly getting in the car and driving away.
<br/><br/>
While he could go in and catch them in the act, but that terrifying scene would blind his eyes. He doesn’t plan on wronging his own eyes to look at this play for the sake of Yang Yuanhang.
<br/><br/>
He will just let Yang Yuanhang cherish his luck for a while more.
　　<br/><br/>
Besides, it won’t be long before he slaughter this small piglet and cook it inside a pot.
　　<br/><br/>
