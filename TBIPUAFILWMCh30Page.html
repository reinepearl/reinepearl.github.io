In the end, Xu Yanyan really didn’t stay at the reception desk nor continue to wire customer calls.
<br/><br/>
It wasn’t because of any special reason. Instead, it was because the Human Resource Director suddenly realized: although the reception desk and wiring calls didn’t require any specialized skills, but the requirement for EQ was still very high.
<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan, this type of person who lost her position due to opening her mouth too much, has a really high chance of causing an accident by staying at this type of position and can implicate him!
　　<br/><br/>
So after much consideration, he made Xu Yanyan fill the position of a recently retired office worker who inputs information into the computer.
<br/><br/>
Everyday, she will input and copy information and didn’t require her to communicate with other people and also didn’t need to use her brain. It was a job that can be done by a high schooler.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Of course, Xu Yanyan was unwilling.
<br/><br/>
The work of inputting information was actually not any different from the reception desk. Not only was the work dull and dry, it also didn’t have any future prospects for advancement. 
<br/><br/>
Although the wage she had when she worked as the CEO’s assistant wasn’t high, but at the very least, she could come in contact with the CEO everyday. If she was lucky, she might soar to the sky one day.
　　<br/><br/>
Once she remembered that she will immediately lose that job which everyone was fighting for and will become a lowly office worker, who will stare at the dull and dry documents everyday, Xu Yanyan was about to quickly collapse.
　　<br/><br/>
Maybe it was because of how smooth everything has been that her ego became big and made her thought that she was really an accomplished person and that she has the power to speak in front of her boss that she had done such a brainless matter.
<br/><br/>
At this time, Xu Yanyan finally woke up and began regretting.
<br/><br/>
But it was already too late.
　　<br/><br/>
For Fu Shijun to not directly fire her was already giving her face. If she was to continu<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->e seeking death, then there’s a chance that she won’t even be an office worker anymore.
<br/><br/>
For a big company like the Fu Corporation, the threshold was very high. Even if it was the position of an office worker, there was still fierce competition from the outside fighting for it. With her ordinary undergraduate degree and no work experience level, if she were to be kicked out of Fu Corporation, then it was an impossible matter to re-enter again.
　　<br/><br/>
After Xu Yanyan transferred away, this type of small incident was settled in dust with no one caring for it anymore.
　　<br/><br/>
No, to be accurate, except for——
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu.
　　<br/><br/>
Ever since he discovered his son secretly touching his red ears, he became alert with many question marks in his heart.
<br/><br/>
Something is going on. There is definitely something going on. It may even have something to do with that assistant that bumped that cup!
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu had hoped for a small daughter-in-law for a few years now. Towards this matter, he was especially passionate. At this moment, he was itching to have someone investigate on what had happened.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Although he had already been retired for several years, but his prestige was still present. To investigate small matters doesn’t require much effort.　　
<br/><br/>
Without alerting Fu Shijun, a report of the matters regarding that day and the follow ups were all presented to Grandfather Fu.
<br/><br/>
He looked at the document and lightly “yi” in surprise.
　　<br/><br/>
He guessed wrong. That assistant called Xu Yanyan didn’t have any special qualities.
<br/><br/>
This was apparent from how she was handled after her mistake.
　　<br/><br/>
Although his smallest son was outwardly indifferent, but after knowing each other for so many years, he knows that Fu Shijun has a small habit of defending a friend even though they are in the wrong.
<br/><br/>
The mistakes of talking out of turn and overturning a cup of water on their superior’s body can be either big or small. It all depends on whether the superior wanted to continue tracking it. If his son really like this female assistant, then he will definitely not allow her to do this type of low work.
　　<br/><br/>
But this is also good. He also doesn’t like this assistant.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
To dare make decisions for Su Zui, did she think going to work is the same as playing palace schemes?
<br/><br/>
This type of stupid woman, if his son were to really like her, he will really get a headache.
　　<br/><br/>
Although his lower limit has been constantly dropping and he already doesn’t have any high requirements for the daughter-in-law Fu Shijun will bring home, but this type of woman who is clearly doing bad things will only bring trouble to those who marry her.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu thought for awhile before telling the senior executive on the other side of the phone: “Help me pay attention. Besides Xiao Zui, who else is close to Shijun recently.”
<br/><br/>
Xu Yanyan has been crossed out of the suspect list, but Grandfather Fu didn’t wipe this matter away in his heart.
<br/><br/>
That’s right. No matter what, based on the matter of the suddenly red ear tip, he was sure that something unspeakable happened on his son’s side.
<br/><br/>
If it wasn’t Xu Yanyan, then there were still other people!
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
The second day at eight o’clock. President Fu, who had just returned from his second round in the hospital, was completely professional and appeared in his office on time. Just as before, his back still had Su Zui following him, as if he were Fu Shijun’s tail.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Except today, President Fu’s expression was slightly unnatural.
　　<br/><br/>
One could say he looked happy, but his eyebrows were wrinkled.
<br/><br/>
One could say he looked unhappy, but his eyes clearly contained some undisguised joy.
<br/><br/>
Ever since he entered the office, his gaze had mostly rest on Su Zui’s body so much that even the work that usually grabbed all his attention lost their attractiveness. 
　　<br/><br/>
At this rate, the work progress was too low. After enduring for half an hour, Su Zui was really unable to pretend to be blind. After Fu Shijun once again ignored his question, he helplessly asked: “Big boss, what happened? Do you not want to work today?”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun immediately pursed his lips and denied: “No.”
<br/><br/>
In front of workaholic Su Zui, President Fu felt that his most qualifying aspect was his work capability. How could he admit that he didn’t want to work?
　　<br/><br/>
Just when he finished denying, the expression in his eyes started becoming distracted onc<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->e again: “Don’t call me boss,” After a pause, he called him in a low voice: “......Zui Zui.”
<br/><br/>
Hearing the address at the very end, Su Zui can’t help but raise his eyebrows.
<br/><br/>
Most nicknames always carried an intimate feeling. Hearing the two words coming from Fu Shijun’s low and deep magnetic voice, he felt his ears become numb in a split second.
<br/><br/>
Without waiting for Su Zui to do anything, Fu Shijun’s Adam apple rolled and he asked: “Can I call you like this?”
<br/><br/>
He had actually wanted to call Su Zui like this very early on, but nicknames can only be used with very close people. Su Zui’s grandfather can call him Xiao Zui. He was an outsider. Just what qualifications does he have to use a more intimate address?
　　<br/><br/>
But now, it’s different.
<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui didn’t give him a reply to his confession that day, but they had already kissed twice. Su Zui even touched his back. Most probably......most probably, it counts as an agreement?
　　<br/><br/>
President Fu’s heart was full of worries about gains and losses.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
According to reason, since they had already gone this far, it wasn’t a big deal to ask for a definite answer from Su Zui, but his heart still felt faintly at unease.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui looked gentle and obedient outwardly, but he was actually not an easy person to get close to.
<br/><br/>
It was as if he had drawn a line between himself and all the people in this world. Even the most intimate relations had some sort of self-control, as if he could leave anytime.
<br/><br/>
He had spent so long before he was able to carefully put a foot passed that line and not get kicked out. He was afraid if he made his actions were too extreme, he will directly be kicked out from that line.
　　<br/><br/>
It was better to be like this and slowly cook the frog in warm water. As he slowly cook, maybe he will cook him so much that he won’t be able to leave.
　　<br/><br/>
The corner of Su Zui’s mouth twitched: “......” He had already called, what was the use of asking him.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s attitude of act first ask second was like a kid afraid of his mother not buying him his toy so he first tore apart the packaging and put it in his own hand.
<br/><br/>
It was good that he didn’t dislike how Fu Shijun called him. The corner of his lips turned up and he very generously said: “Up to you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Yet, Fu Shijun wasn’t a bit satisfied.
<br/><br/>
“Zui Zui,” he called once again. A faint light flashed across his black eyes and he said: “You can also change my address.”
　　<br/><br/>
“......”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
Su Zui instantly became silent and finally realized that if he didn’t appease his agitated and unease boss today, then there wouldn’t be any work done.
<br/><br/>
As a result, he put down the documents in his hand, stood up and walked to Fu Shijun’s side, and extended his hand until it touched the back of the chair, very similar to that of a kabedon position.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s nervousness became very apparent due to his actions.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui leaned over. His clear eyes unblinkingly looked at the overbearing president beneath his body and he lightly asked: “What do you want me to call you?”
<br/><br/>
The speed of which the overbearing president’s ears turning red could be seen with the naked eye. After a moment, he said: “......Directly calling me by name is good.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was very agreeable: “Ok, Shijun.”
　　<br/><br/>
The redness quickly spread from the tip of Fu Shijun’s ears to his earlobes.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s throat rolled a few times: “......Call me that again.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui directly acceded to every plea: “Shijun.”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/>
After calling for the second time, he lips turned to a smile. His eyes looked as if it was seeped with water and became much more gentle.
　　<br/><br/>
Because Su Zui lowered his head, the distance between the two was very close. From Fu Shijun’s angle, he could clearly see his own reflection from that pair of clean eyes.
<br/><br/>
At this point, even his neck can’t help but also became red. His deep eyes stared at Su Zui for several seconds before suddenly raising his hand and pressed on that slender neck. He turned his head and accurately kissed that pair of thin lips that he had been thinking of for the whole night.
　　<br/><br/>
Although Su Zui was towering from above and had the advantage, but he wasn’t as strong as Fu Shijun at this aspect. Once his tongue was grabbed and sucked a few times by another, he quickly lost his advantage and was grabbed by the waist and onto Fu Shijun’s legs.
　　<br/><br/>
Of course, this was also him being half willing and half unwilling. With how Fu Shijun can only use one arm, to want to act overbearing and force himself onto him was on a level beyond the human limit.
　　<br/><br/>
Forget it, Su Zui thought. It seems that he was a bit lazy towards this type of stuff. Since Fu Shijun was willing to work, then let him to all the work.
<br/><br/>
He carefully avoided Fu Shijun’s injured arm and leaned his shoulder on the broad chest. He relaxed and opened his mouth, allowing the beast patrolling in front of his door to enter.
　　<br/><br/>
He can’t help but admit Fu Shijun’s leg muscles were very powerful. It was warm and flexible and wasn’t any worse than sitting on a high end sofa.
　　<br/><br/>
This was the third time. Fu Shijun finally learned how to not be so fierce when kissing his lover and even learned how to go in deep and come out shallow. Su Zui still felt comfortable from his nibbling. The thought of appeasing the other at the start had unknowingly disappeared without a trace. Without realization, his breathing had become deeper and he had become engrossed in the actions.
<br/><br/>
He touched the back of Fu Shijun’s neck. His palm was tickled by the short hair.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Both of them were so absorbed that none of them noticed that at an unknown time, the CEO’s office door was slowly pushed open from the outside.
　　<br/><br/>
This was actually their carelessness. But it was also because of the heavy prestige attached to Fu Shijun’s office. All the subordinates follow their protocol. Ever since Su Zui started working with them to now, no one had dared to not knock before entering. After getting used to this, he had lost his vigilance. 
　　<br/><br/>
It can only be said that they were really misfortunate because the person who entered this time wasn’t an ordinary person.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu saw his son doing what can be said to be in full swing in the office and his first reaction was to quickly slam shut the door and prevent other people from peeking.
<br/><br/>
After that, due to lingering fears, he turned his head.
<br/><br/>
He had originally came with the wishful thinking to do an unannounced inspection, but he didn’t think he will really see an office play scene!
　　<br/><br/>
When he opened the door, it was only a slight crack......there shouldn’t be anyone who saw it? 
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu was old. Seeing how heated his younger generations were, he felt very awkward. After hurriedly recognizing that the person in Fu Shijun’s chest was a slender male, he forcibly press down the excitement in his heart and turned his gaze away as if nothing happened: “......Are, are you busy?”
　　<br/><br/>
“......”
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
“......”
　　<br/><br/>
The office entered a frightening silence. No one answered his question.
<br/><br/>
A few seconds later, Grandfather Fu felt that something wasn’t right and turned his head and saw that the person in Fu Shijun’s chest wasn’t a stranger. His eye balls almost fell out: “Xiao Zui?!”
　　<br/><br/>
What happened?! How did his son snatched away his long time friend’s grandson?!
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Three months later, Su Zhimo’s judgement was passed down.
<br/><br/>
The result was as expected. With lawsuits coming from an unknown source, she was again fastened with several criminal charges. After adding everything up, she needed to spend thirty years in jail.
<br/><br/>
The lawyer told her without any qualm that if she were to pay her tax payments and fines, she could have at least seven or eight years less from her sentence.
　　<br/><br/>
In actuality, the lawyer from the Fu Corporation had given her money from the Fu Family for her living fees.Iit wasn’t small and the amount was still in the millions. For any ordinary family, it was enough to raise five children to adulthood. It could be said that the actions were full of benevolence and righteousness. 
<br/><br/>
But these few millions were only drops of water in an empty cup compared to the huge tax <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->payments and fines.
　　<br/><br/>
The days living in prison weren’t good at all. The security guards were all strict and complied with the regulations. Her good luck was basically useless. The most it could do was to have a couple more pieces of meat during meal time.
<br/><br/>
After three months in prison, it had already tortured Su Zhimo’s arrogance and made her thinner by a lot. The original fitting clothes now hang loosely on her body.
　　<br/><br/>
But compared to the torture to the body, it was more frigthening for the mind.
<br/><br/>
What Xie Yan took away was not only her life saving money, but also her hope.
　　<br/><br/>
In these three months, the thing she had remembered the most wasn’t Fu Shijun, who had personally pushed her into place, nor was it Su Zui, who helped push the tide from behind, instead it was her mother, who was her last hope.
<br/><br/>
The amount of trust and intimacy she had for Xie Yan in the past was how much hatred and madness she had for Xie Yan now.
　　<br/><br/>
For an unknown number of nights, she would curled at the corner of the bed and speak all sorts of poisonous words to curse Xie Yan with eyes full of hatred.
<br/><br/><center>————————</center><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph4">
It wasn’t known if it was because Su Zhimo’s curse was actually useful but Xie Yan’s experience wasn’t as smooth as one would think.
<br/><br/>
After taking several thousands from Su Zhimo’s lawyer, without a bit of hesitation, she took an airplane that night and flew abroad without a thought for the divorce between her and Su Chengzhi.
<br/><br/>
The things Su Chengzhi gave her were only worth a small amount. It wasn’t much more than several thousands!
　　<br/><br/>
This airplane ride was very long. Midway, Xie Yan fell asleep and dreamed of her daughter questioning her sternly on why she betrayed her.
<br/><br/>
In her dream, she cried and said: “I’m sorry, mama didn’t have any choice......”
　　<br/><br/>
What can she do?!
<br/><br/>
She investigated before. Even if she paid these thousands of dollars, the most it could do was deduct several years from Su Zhimo’s sentence. It was a very impractical use of money.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Wouldn’t it be better if she took this money and waited outside. After Su Zhimo comes out, she could still somewhat take care of her.
　　<br/><br/>
“Money......I’ll help you......save it......”
　　<br/><br/>
But Su Zhimo didn’t understand her and only repeatedly question her. Her expression gradually warped and two trails of blood tears dripped from her eyes.
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan was trapped in the nightmare. Her whole body was covered with cold sweat yet she was unable to wake up.
　　<br/><br/>
“Madam, madam,” a warm and pleasant voice sounded in Xie Yan’s ears and woke her up from the nightmare: “Are you ok? Do you require assistance?”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan opened her eyes and saw a golden hair and blue eyed tall man covered with an extravagant aura. A pair of deep blue eyes was currently staring at her.
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan was at a loss for a moment before giving him a warm smile and used English to reply: “Thank you. I’m ok. I only had a nightmare.”
　　<br/><br/>
The golden haired man seemed to be very interested in her. Throughout the whole journey, he conversed with her. With kind words and a charming attitude, it caused people to feel as if they were bathed in the spring breeze.
<br/><br/>
Through the conversations, Xie Yan discovered that this was a son from a rich family who had recently graduated and was currently taking a trip with the same destination as her.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
Sensing that this person unexpectedly expose his strong family background, Xie Yan’s eyes can’t help but shine.
　　<br/><br/>
The two’s conversation on the plane was very agreeable. Once they descended, they had already exchanged contact information.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan was originally a person without much morals. Because she also felt guilt towards her daughter and extreme unease, she hurriedly tried to find a pillar of support.
<br/><br/>
With the appearance of such a handsome and rich man, it was as if heaven had sent her a floating raft.
　　<br/><br/>
As expected, the two smoothly entered a period of passionate love. In the foreign land, Xie Yan had experienced love that she had missed for who knows how many years and her whole person became younger by a few years.
<br/><br/>
She had cleanly forgot all the mess in her domestic country.
　　<br/><br/>
Of course, because of this love that had reinvorigated her, she could have never thought that just one year later, the huge sum of money that she had obtained from daughter was cleanly stolen away by her “rich” boyfriend.
<br/><br/>
After knowing she couldn’t get any results after reporting to the police abroad, she could only unwillingly return and find assets Su Chengzhi left her after the divorce. 
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, how could she have thought that Su Chengzhi already torn apart the divorce papers and that they were still husbands and wives like before.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
This time, Xie Yan proposed the divorce and Su Chengzhi looked at her as if she was a joke.
<br/><br/>
“Divorce? You cheap people dream too much! The person you had me wear the green hat for had already entered prison. In the future, you can know your place and serve me! If I’m happy with your service, I’ll give you some money to spend! If I’m not happy, don’t even think about getting a single coin!”
　　<br/><br/>
Because his wife had caused him to wear a green hat for twenty years, Su Chengzhi was almost angered to the point that he had to enter the hospital. Although in the end, he didn’t suffer too much, but his mouth became more twisted, his looks became warped, and his body became fatter by ten kilograms due to negligence. 
<br/><br/>
His whole person was unable to return to that refined and elegant look and had thoroughly turned into a twisted mouth, squinty eyes, and oily fat middle age man.
　　<br/><br/>
When he talks, the muscles on his face twitched as if he was a living evil spirit.
<br/><br/>
Once she thought about how she will have to live with such a disgusting person in the future, Xie Yan’s brain became numb and she screeched: “No, no——I want to leave!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi walked two steps forwards and tightly grabbed her arm. His eyes were as cold as a poisonous snake: “Don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. You had already voluntarily re-entered this net and you still want to leave? Ok. You can try. If you can leave, I’ll take your surname!”
<br/><br/>
After speaking, without waiting for Xie Yan’s objections, he pulled her downstairs pushed her into the broom closet and locked the door.
　　<br/><br/>
The broom closet was very dark and cold. The air was also not good. A moment after Xie Yan entered, she could feel herself inhaling a stomach full of dust and couldn’t stop coughing.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost. You should be reading this on reinepearl.github.io-->
The light was also broken. No matter how many times she pressed the switch, there wasn’t a single response.
　　<br/><br/>
“Su Chengzhi, are you crazy? Let me out! I’ll report to the police!”
<br/><br/>
“Su Chengzhi! Su Chengzhi!”
<br/><br/>
“......Chengzhi......it was me in the wrong......please let me out......”
　　<br/><br/>
She cried in a loud voice and she beat the door. The threats and curses in the beginning gradually became sobs asking for forgiveness in the end. But from the start to end, she could only hear her own voice in her ears.
<br/><br/>
She didn’t know where Su Chengzhi went. He didn’t say a single sentence to her or mind her crying and screaming.
　　<br/><br/>
In the endless cold darkness, endless regret and despair appeared. Xie Yan’s screaming voice gradually became smaller and smaller. She leaned on the wall. Her tears unrestrainedly ran down her cheeks.
<br/><br/>
She put her hand on the unmovable door handle and can only feel the cold rising up from her foot, causing her whole body to shiver as if she dropped into an ice cave.
