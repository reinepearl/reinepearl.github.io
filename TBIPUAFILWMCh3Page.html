								“So this is Su family’s daughter. I heard before that her beauty was out of this world and now I can see that it was not exaggeration.”
　　<br/><br/>
“Preside Xu is too polite. She can’t compare up to Young Master Ling. He is able to be so successful when he is still so young. That design file he made previously makes us elders embarrassed just by looking at it.”
　　<br/><br/>
“Su Zhimo also isn’t bad. She haven’t graduated yet she was able to help out in the company. She will definitely be able to alleviate your duties after she graduate.”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing how other people praise his daughter, Su Chengzhi is unable to stop his face from expressing how pleased he is, even though he knew it was just pleasantries. 
　　<br/><br/>
He gazed over the dazzling meeting place.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu family’s status is extraordinary, but they are extremely low-key. If it wasn’t because that this was the grandfather’s long life party<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>, then there couldn’t be such a fancy banquet.
<br/><br/>
This opportunity is very rare. There is still one more hour before the banquet ends. Most guests had already talked their fill and is now hanging out with friends.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi took a look around and when he found that each and every guest were a reputable figure, his mood increasingly became better.
<br/><br/>
Looking at President Xu, who manipulated some strings to obtain this invitation for him, Su Chengzhi’s smile became more genuine. 
　　<br/><br/>
He pushed his daughter forward a bit and said: “Come here Su Zhimo. This is your uncle’s son. You young people should have plenty of topics to discuss. Go get to know each other. If there is nothing to do, you guys can also go out and hang out.”
　　　<br/><br/>
Feeling the strength behind the push, Su Zhimo’s smile faintly froze. She really wants to swipe off Su Chengzhi’s hand but she endured in the end.
　　<br/><br/>
That Young Master Xu looked at Su Zhimo. A stunned look passed over his face and he sincerely praised: “Lady Su looks really good today.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was wearing a red evening dress today. Her appearance was stylishly beautiful and was able to match up to the color. Not only did she not look superficial, instead she had an air of elegance. 
　　<br/><br/>
Young Master Xu, who originally did not acknowledge and Su family and felt faintly ill when he was called over, completely forgot his previous notions and kindly chatted with Su Zhimo.
　　<br/><br/>
Not even a half hour passed and he acted like he was possessed and eagerly promised Su Zhimo that he could introduce connections to her: “There is a banquet at the racetrack this weekend. If you are interested in riding horses, I can teach you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo lightly laughed and replied: “Thank you very much Young Master Xu.”
　　<br/><br/>
The two people was getting familiar with each other when suddenly there was a large uproar at the entrance, causing many to gather towards the entrance.
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi looked at the time. The time to leave the banquet wasn’t for another ten minutes before he suddenly realized: “It should be President Fu’s arrival!”
　　<br/><br/>
The President Fu that he mentioned wasn’t the main lead of the banquet Grandfather Fu. When Grandfather Fu was young, he was indeed a famous businessman.  However, his current age is already old and have long since retired. Nowadays, Fu family’s authoritative power is in the hands of Grandfather Fu’s smallest son Fu Shijun.
　　<br/><br/>
Everyone respected Grandfather Fu due to his power and influence; however, if one wants to climb up, then one has to look to Fu family’s current patriarch. 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi hurrily brought Su Zhimo over and softly advised: “Zhimo, when you see President Fu later, you need to be more sensible.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had been in control of the Fu family for several years, but has yet to marry or had any lovers. His name is so clean it seem fake. 
<br/><br/>
When he first inherited the position, it was still ok. However, as time pass on and his side remained empty, many people started to worry.
　　<br/><br/>
Madam Fu is such an important position. How can it remain empty?
<br/><br/>
Even if one takes a step back and not obtain the title Madam Fu, being connected to Fu family’s patriarch is enough to benefit from endlessly.
　　<br/><br/>
Everyone always say that the entertainment circle is dirty and full of unspoken rules. In reality, if there is a circle, then there will always be people doing underhanded things.
<br/><br/>
If one were to look closely, they will find that there is an excessive amount of beautiful young girls in tonight’s banquet.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo silently listened and did not say anything. She understands Su Chengzhi’s meaning, but she knows clearly that a future with Fu Shijun is impossible.
　　<br/><br/>
However, Su Chengzhi doesn’t need to know this.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Su Chengzhi walked half way there before the crowd of people suddenly made way. 
<br/><br/>
He wanted to take this opportunity to go over but when he saw who everyone was crowding around, his footsteps suddenly stopped and his face turned ugly.
　　<br/><br/>
Unexpectedly, the people being surrounded wasn’t the banquet’s main lead; however, they were still a very important guest.
　　<br/><br/>
It was his past father-in-law and the current Qin family patriarch, Grandfather Qin.
　　<br/><br/>
Of course, if it was just like this then Su Chengzhi’s reaction wouldn’t be so big. What made him stunned was that by Grandfather Qin’s side was a very familiar figure.
　　<br/><br/>
——It was his eldest son who was arguing with him yesterday, Su Zui.
　　<br/><br/>
Currently, Su Zui was wearing a set of dark blue suit. He did not wear a tie but a faint golden chain was fastened to his collar.
　　<br/><br/>
No matter if it was the dark blue color or the faint gold, both colors are easy to nitpick. If one wasn’t careful, it would easily seem as if the person is uncouth.
<br/><br/>
However when the two colors were put on Su Zui’s body, it was as if the match was made for him.
　　<br/><br/>
His skin was extremely white, but not to the point that it makes him look ill. His looks were as delicate as similar his mother. His soft black hair was styled to look slightly messy. The way the messy hair laid on on his forehead compliment his clean black eyes.
<br/><br/>
At first glance, he looked like a prince.
　　<br/><br/>
Almost everyone at the hall lamented in their heart. The successors of other families can’t be compare to the Qin family’s grandson.
　　<br/><br/>
Even Su Zhimo was stunned. This is his good-for-nothing stepbrother?
　　<br/><br/>
Of course Su Zui was also aware of his green hat father and his cheap stepsister.
<br/><br/>
Compare to the stunned expressions of the father and daughter pair, Su Zui’s expressions were calm. So much that when their eyes met, he let out an appropriate faint smile.
　　<br/><br/>
Many people followed his sight and when they saw Su Chengzhi and Su Zhimo, their expression immediately changed.
　　<br/><br/>
In rich families, the matter of remarriage isn’t uncommon; however the tasteless way Su Chengzhi had done it was unique.
<br/><br/>
In any case, even if the feelings was unbearable, everyone still needs face in public.
　　<br/><br/>
Oddly enough, when Su Zui didn’t make an appearance, for a short while, everyone really didn’t think about the Su family’s awkward situation. Now that Su Zui stood next to Grandfather Qin’s side with such grand fanfare, it was as if someone took a stick and hit them on the head and reminded them about the “good actions” that Su Chengzhi had done.
<br/><br/>
In an instant, half of the guest cannot help but give the father and daughter pair a peculiar look.
<br/><br/>
The people who originally held good will towards the Su family slowly started backing away one by one.
　　<br/><br/>
Even the Young Master Xu, who was just cordial with Su Zhimo, also came to be. 
<br/><br/>
What happened? Before he arrived, he obviously wanted to stay away from Su family. Yet after one glance, he suddenly became devoted towards Su Zhimo?
　　<br/><br/>
While Su Zhimo is definitly considered pretty, but he was pass the age where beauty could muddle his brain. How could he make such a retarded mistake?
<br/><br/>
Could it be that he was single for too long that his brain isn’t clear-headed?
<br/><br/>
Young Master Xu completely cannot understand and can only silently decide that he should quickly go find a girlfriend and get rid of his single status. 
　　<br/><br/>
Previously, there was a crowd of people around the father and daughter pair. In the next second, the two stood there alone.
　　<br/><br/>
How keen is Su Zhimo?
<br/><br/>
There was a sudden change in attitude amongst the crowd. Naturally, she was able to detect this.
　　<br/><br/>
She narrowed her eyes and saw the delicate face on the reflection of the wine glass. Her indifferent expression did not allow anyone to make out anything.
<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi was unable to keep calm like Su Zhimo. His face became so ugly to the point that the only thing missing were the words “not happy” directly written on his face.
　　<br/><br/>
The crowd of guests saw his attitude and was more unwilling to go near him.
<br/><br/>
As a result, wherever Su Chengzhi and Su Zhimo went, there would be a circle of emptiness around them.
<br/><br/>
This was also an impressive sight.
　　<br/><br/>
A few minutes later, the Fu family showed up.
<br/><br/>
Everyone’s attention quickly divert their attention from this sesame story<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a> to tonight’s real main lead.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Grandfather Qin: “The fact that you can make this decision so early actually makes me very surprised.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui carefully supported his grandfather from the side. In a low voice that seems to carry some awkwardness, he said: “I can’t play for a life-time. I’m already over twenty.”
<br/><br/>
The elder comforted him: “Learning right now isn’t too late. When I was your age, I was still playing around. It was when I reached thirty that I grew up and slowly began learning.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui said: “No, I don’t dare to compare. How can I be as smart as grandfather?”
　　<br/><br/>
The deliberate act of being obedient made the grandfather laugh. For a while, the grandfather’s wrinkled covered hands grasped Su Zui’s before he said: “It’s good that you thought things through. If your mom knows, she will definitely be very happy.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui made a low sound of confirmation.
<br/><br/>
One after the other, people came up to propose a toast. Su Zui recalled that elders aren’t suited to drinking alcohol and took his grandfather’s share too.
　　<br/><br/>
Actually, he feels that the original’s grandfather was most pitiful in the novel.
<br/><br/>
He was originally at an old age and had already retired for several years. Yet when his only daughter passed away, he had no choice but to take up the family responsibility once again.
<br/><br/>
Even if he is wise and capable, in the end he is still an elderly man. His body and energy differ from that of a young adult. After working hard for ten years, his body have nearly completely degraded.
　　<br/><br/>
It’s no wonder that after seeing a photo of his grandson and another man in bed, he became angry to the point of entering the intensive care.
<br/><br/>
In actuality, this elder is very open-minded. If he were to be given more time, it’s not impossible for him to accept this matter.
　　<br/><br/>
Remembering this elder’s ending, Su Zui said: “You should go take a break. Other family’s elders are all enjoying their retirement.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin doesn’t seem to mind: “I can’t say idle. And you, drink less. Don’t keep drinking with all the people that comes up for a toast. Young people should cherish their bodies. Wait until you are old and you will regret it to the point of crying.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui said: “I’ll care about it when I’m old. You should pay more attention to yourself.”
　　<br/><br/>
Although he is around the same age as Grandfather Fu, Grandfather Qin looks older by quite a bit. 
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu evidently feels the same.
<br/><br/>
He looked at his old friend and the wine glass that was originally ready for toasting forcefully change directions until it was stuffed into the hands of his youngest son.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “......”
<br/><br/>
His other hand originally had a glass. Now that both of his hands hold wine glasses, the image looked outrageous and he can only give one of the wine glasses to the waiter at the side.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu sighed loudly: “Lao<a href = "#footnote3bottom" id = "footnote3top">(3)</a> Qin, I signed up for an fitness class and felt that the results were very good. Do you want to go with me?”
<br/><br/>
He hasn’t seen his old friend for a few months, yet he felt that his friend look more haggard?　　
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin said: “Hai. I’m still busy. You can go enjoy your fitness class on your own.”
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu: “Listen to my advice. All humans acquiesce to old age. Is this Xiao Zui? It’s been such a long time. You already grown so big. You look exactly like your mother. In the future, you will definitely be the same as your mother. You should let the younger generation inherit the family business and retire. Don’t always be so worried about stuff.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin matchingly returned the pleasantries: “You are too kind. My grandson is still too young without enough experience. Why don’t you look at Shijun. He’s exactly the same as you back when you were young.”
　　<br/><br/>
While the two elders are immersed in their world, the two younglings are also not idle.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui size up the banquet’s other main lead.
　　<br/><br/>
This was undoubtedly an imposing man. His facial features were very handsome. His height was at least one hundred and ninety meters. Like a clothes mannequin, he wore his simple black tailored suit perfectly.
<br/><br/>
With just one glance, he can sense the danger from this person’s aura.
　　<br/><br/>
Because they both belonged to the same category, he originally wanted to be further away from this person.
<br/><br/>
Of course, it’s best if they weren’t enemies.
　　<br/><br/>
This type of person who makes even him feel threatened, he really don’t know how the female lead defeated him.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui urged again: “System, hurry and absorb some of boss’ aura and see if you can can upgrade. Even if it’s not the main lead, the boss is also pretty good.”
<br/><br/>
System 555’s mechanical voice sounds faintly desperate: “......Apologies host but system doesn’t have this function.”
　　<br/><br/>
That’s right. The person in front of his eyes is the novel’s final boss.
　　<br/><br/>
According to the novel’s plot, ninety-nine percent of the main leads’ history involved being raised outside of a rich families. Su Zhimo was not an exception.
<br/><br/>
As for the rich family who accidentally left her out, it was, without suspense, the novel’s most powerful family: the Fu family.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo’s biological father was Fu Shijun’s brother, a rich N generation<a href = "#footnote4bottom" id = "footnote4top">(4)</a> who was completely submerged a life of pleasure.
<br/><br/>
Actually, this muddle-headed rich N generation sleeping with a small housekeeper wasn’t anything serious. However, without even remembering the person’s face, he was able to create a huge hidden danger to his family.
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zhimo obtained the Qin family, she went back to Fu family to compete with Fu Shijun for power.
<br/><br/>
This was the novel’s most important plot. Su Zhimo competed with her biological uncle for more than ten years, causing Fu family to experience a period of turmoil before finally obtaining victory.
　　<br/><br/>
Compare to Su Zui, a two page small cannon fodder, Fu Shijun had comparably more scenes than that of the male lead, so much that it can be considered a villain king.
<br/><br/>
Currently, this villain king extended his hand out towards Su Zui. In a low deep voice that carry a hint of allurance, he said concisely: “Fu Shijun.”
　　<br/><br/>
This person’s bone structure is big. The hands were bigger than Su Zui’s hands by one circle, giving people a sense of safety.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui paused before extending his hands: “Su Zui.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s hands were very warm.
<br/><br/>
Having his hands wrapped up in Fu Shijun’s palms, Su Zui had the misconception of being controlled.
<br/><br/>
He was not used to the feeling of being pressured. After grasping for a while, he let go.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was also sizing up this rarely seen child, who belonged to the old friend of his family.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s outer appearance looks very harmless and his expression looks very obedient. No matter how you look at it, this was a very lovable child.
<br/><br/>
Yet he doesn’t know why, but he felt that something wasn’t correct.
　　<br/><br/>
Like a wolf wearing a sheep’s clothing and mixing in with a group of sheep, pretending to be well-behaved. Even if they look alike, there would always be a sense of discord. In the eyes of the like-minded, they would always be faintly distinguishable.
　　<br/><br/>
The two looked at each other, with each having their own plans.
<br/><br/>
On one side, grandfather Qin suddenly said loudly: “Zui Zui<a href = "#footnote5bottom" id = "footnote5top">(5)</a>, how can you address him like that? The seniority is all messed up. This is your Uncle Fu. Your Uncle Fu have plenty of experience in all sort of things. If you have the opportunity later on, you should have him teach you.”
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Fu expressed his agreement: “Shijun, quit putting on a cold face. This is your Yin jie’s<a href = "#footnote6bottom" id = "footnote6top">(6)</a> son. He is technically your nephew. If you have time, you should look after him.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui was stunned for a second: “......”
<br/><br/>
Because Fu Shijun looks young, he subconsciously put the other as the same position as himself. For a moment, he forgot that Fu Shijun and he are separated by one generation.
　　<br/><br/>
This body’s alcohol tolerance isn’t that good. Su Zui have been drinking several glasses of wine in Grandfather Qin’s place and his face is already becoming red.
<br/><br/>
However, he didn’t notice.
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, the small friend, who Fu Shijun had his guard up against just a while ago, stare blankly for a moment before suddenly forming crescents with his eyes. With a red face, he obediently said: “Uncle.”
　　<br/><br/>
Unexplainably, Fu Shijun’s mood suddenly became a bit peculiar: “.......”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s mood also became a bit peculiar.
<br/><br/>
His brain suddenly sounded out a mission notification.
　　<br/><br/>
[Side mission 1: Be a winner in life.]
<br/><br/>
[Mission summary: Attack<a href = "#footnote8bottom" id = "footnote8top">(7)</a> the female lead/male lead/boss. Establish a stable partner relationship and you will be able to enjoy the luck halo together and become a winner in life! Go young cannon fodder go!]
<br/><br/>
[Mission rewards: 10000 experience points.]
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
The author has something to say:
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: I feel like I’m a cloth star.jpg<a href = "#footnote9bottom" id = "footnote9top">(8)</a>

								<p id = "contentFootnote">Footnote:
								<br/><br/> <a href = "#footnote1top" id = "footnote1bottom">1</a>: Long life party is when elder reached a really old age and a big banquet is held to celebrate their birthday.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote2top" id = "footnote2bottom">2</a>:  It’s referring to dark sesame, meaning that it is unclean. Such as how if you are refer to as a sesame dumpling, then it means you are white on the outside but black on the inside.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote3top" id = "footnote3bottom">3</a>: Like “xiao”, “lao” is an endearment you put before someone’s name but that person is usually old.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote4top" id = "footnote4bottom">4</a>: N as in lots of numbers. So instead of being a “rich second generation”, it is a “rich N generation”.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote5top" id = "footnote5bottom">5</a>: Su Zui’s nickname that Grandfather Qin made by repeating the “Zui” part of his name twice.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote6top" id = "footnote6bottom">6</a>: Yin is part of Su Zui’s mother’s name. Fu Shijun and Su Zui’s mothers aren’t biological siblings. It’s just part of Chinese culture to call people of the same generation by sister or brother. The “jie” here is the pinyin for older sister.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote8top" id = "footnote8bottom">7</a>: Attack not in the physical sense. It’s similar to how chinese novels use the word “counterattack” except the opposite meaning now.
<br/><br/>
<a href = "#footnote9top" id = "footnote9bottom">8</a>: The author is referring to this <a href ="http://www.bee-ji.com/detail/120490.html">image</a>. I don’t really understand what it means either.
