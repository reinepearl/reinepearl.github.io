								Su Zui coldly looked at Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
The first thought in his brain was.
<br/><br/>
If he still dares to extend his legs, I will break those legs for you!
　　<br/><br/>
His second thought was——
<br/><br/>
Su Zui faintly smiled: “Sweetie, did something strange enter your database?”
<br/><br/>
What small small foot? A size forty small small foot?!
　　<br/><br/>
System 555 proudly raised its nonexistent chest: “That’s right host! Us systems had added a new emotion AI to match the procedures! We strive to give the host the most humane service and the most comfortable experience as the vigorous mission continues!”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui gave a few haha fake laughs and said: “It’s so comfortable that I should really thank all your systems.”
<br/><br/>
System 555 was overwhelmed by the praise: “Host doesn’t need to be polite!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
A certain someone is angry. Yet if his body became bad from the anger, there was no one to take his place.
<br/><br/>
To be angry with a premature system, he will only die from anger himself. In addition, there was no one to feel distress for him.
　　<br/><br/>
Ah, that’s wrong. There was still that extending his foot towards the love route boss on the side.
　　<br/><br/>
Without knowing why, Fu Shijun felt that the atmosphere in the private room suddenly became a bit old.
<br/><br/>
The gaze that Su Zui directed at him faintly carried a bit of murderous intentions.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: ? ? ?
<br/><br/>
He hasn't started talking yet? How come Su Zui already became unhappy?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “What’s wrong? Is your stomach uncomfortable?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui restraint his mood and innocently said: “No, I was only a bit distracted. You can say it now.”
<br/><br/>
He was pondering how he should firmly yet politely reject Fu Shijun when he confessed to him.
　　<br/><br/>
As a result, he saw Fu Shijun say to him with a grave expression: “Su Zhimo is actually not Su Chengzhi’s child.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
He already took off his pants, yet Fu Shijun was actually bringing up Su Zhimo?
　　<br/><br/>
Worrying about it for half a day and making him all nervous like this but it turned out Fu Shijun wasn’t preparing to confess to him.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Su Zui suddenly felt a bit awkward.
<br/><br/>
The other person only like him a little bit. It didn’t mean he will definitely chase after him, yet he was already thinking on how to reject him.
<br/><br/>
This way of thinking was really narcissistic. 
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui quickly fixed his mood and his round eyes showed a bit of surprise: “What?”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun lightly coughed. For a constantly calm man, it was rare for him to stutter: “She......she is the result of my second brother’s love affair back in those years.”
<br/><br/>
He pursed the corner of his mouth and firmly stated his thought: “I had only recently known of this myself. Don’t be angry. Our Fu Family will definitely not recognize her!”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui lowered his eyes: “......I won’t. I’m not angry.”
<br/><br/>
Seeing how nervous the boss was when he pledged to him, Su Zui’s mood became a bit complicated.
　　<br/><br/>
While he doesn’t have his memories, but he could still aware that he likes men.
<br/><br/>
To be honest, Fu Shijun was actually a very ideal love interest.
<br/><br/>
His looks, figure, family background, and personality were nothing anyone could nitpick on. In addition, it was rare for him to not have a feeling of repulse with someone.
　　<br/><br/>
Facing this type who always take care of him and aesthetically pleasing admirer, if he was an original resident of this world, he may actually be moved.
　　<br/><br/>
But this was a mission world and he have missions to do.
<br/><br/>
Since he was already bound to the system to do missions, then he will definitely be unable to stay in this world forever.
　　<br/><br/>
If separation was inevitable, then it was better to not have any relationship in the first place.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing how Su Zui’s mood wasn’t high, Fu Shijun wanted to comfort him.
<br/><br/>
But in reality, he has never done this type of delicate activity.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
After hesitating for half a day, the only thing he did was extend his hand and comfortably pat Su Zui’s thin shoulders.
<br/><br/>
“Don’t feel bad. It’s not your fault.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui tilted his head and his eyes revealed a bit of craftiness: “Why should I feel bad? The person who should feel bad is Su Chengzhi. The daughter that he spoiled to heaven was turned out not to be planted by him. I hope when he became aware of this, he will become more staunch.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui took advantage of the gap he created when he turned his body to grab his jacket to seamlessly removed himself from Fu Shijun’s palms.
<br/><br/>
He said: “Uncle, you don’t need to worry. I will keep this a secret. Whatever the situation is in the Su Family, I already don’t care.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s expression was at ease. Fu Shijun was still a bit worried but he didn’t dare say anything.
<br/><br/>
He put on his suit jacket: “I’ll send you home? It’s raining today and the roads are slippery.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui didn’t reject it and smiled: “Then thank you uncle.”
　　<br/><br/>
20% progress was only the degree of a favorable impression.
<br/><br/>
In this world, there are countless affection that wither away.
<br/><br/>
Who knows, maybe in a few days, Fu Shijun will forget this tiny bit of favorable impression by himself.
</p>

<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Not too long after, there was a family company holding an anniversary party in A city.
<br/><br/>
This family company was a frequent collaborator with the Su Company. As a result, Su Chengzhi had naturally received an invitation.
<br/><br/>
He properly dressed up and brought his wife and daughter along.
　　<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Xie Yan was young and pretty. In addition, she took good care of herself.
<br/><br/>
Standing besides the younger and prettier Su Zhimo, the mother and daughter pair naturally attracted the highest number of admirable looks from everyone present.
　　<br/><br/>
As soon as Xie Yan sat down, there were people coming over to chat with her: “You should be Madam Su correct? Seeing is believing. Your figure is maintained really well.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s whole person became happy from the words “Madam Su”.
<br/><br/>
She had relied on dishonorable methods to climb up. Because her husband’s previous wife’s family’s strength was huge, she would frequently received unfair treatment when she participated in high-end occasions with Su Chengzhi.
<br/><br/>
Those arrogant madamns from rich families may not outright mock her, but they would ignore her intentionally or otherwise, making her feel pushed aside by an invisible force.
<br/><br/>
There were a few times where she could kindly go up to greet another person, but that person could pretend to not hear her and keep talking to others with an unchanging expression and act as if she was air.
<br/><br/>
If they were a bit better, they would politely replied to her before turning around and continue talking with another person, a clear indication that they were unwilling to associate with her.
<br/><br/>
Every single time, she could be full of anticipation only to receive a stomach full of disappointment.
<br/><br/>
After a few times, she also stop courting humiliation.
<br/><br/>
It was only because this family company’s level was about the same as Su Family’s company so there wasn’t that many high class people that Su Chengzhi was willing to bring her along.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan contained her smile and said: “Are you Madam Xu? I have also heard of you. Actually, I haven’t intentionally maintain my body’s figure. I only pay attention to my food intake and occasionally work out, and this was the natural result.”
<br/><br/>
She continued: “I heard your family’s son had recently passed the college evaluation. He is really talented.”
　　<br/><br/>
Hearing her mentioning her son, Madam Xu was naturally happy: “It was only a common evaluation......”
<br/><br/>
After she finished bragging about her son, Madam Xu returned the favor and heavily praised Su Zhimo: “......How is Su Zhimo at the company right now?”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan pulled Su Zhimo’s hand and cleverly worded her sentence: “Our family’s Zhimo is still in college right now so she is only going to the company to gain experience. By adapting beforehand, she will be ready to properly work once she graduates.”
　　<br/><br/>
The atmosphere was very cheerful for a while.
<br/><br/>
Finally, Madam Xu can’t resist but say: “Madam Su, you should come out to play more. With such beauty and high EQ, you will definitely receive a lot of welcome./;
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan warmly smiled: “I will.”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
If her EQ wasn’t high, she couldn’t have been able to sit in the position of Madam Su.
<br/><br/>
Before she came, she especially did a lot of homework and remembered nearly all of the attending guest’s circumstances.
　　<br/><br/>
Actually, she had also did this when she previously attended those gatherings.
<br/><br/>
It was only that those rich family madams were unwilling to even associate with her. To do homework was the same as not doing it at all.
　　<br/><br/>
Before, she was set on squeezing into the rich family’s circle.
<br/><br/>
Now she discovered that some stuff should not be forced and may even receive a better result.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s interactions went smoothly, causing Su Chengzhi to receive countless envious looks.
<br/><br/>
Someone toasted Su Chengzhi: “President Su sure is lucky. Not only do you have a successful business, but your family also have two beautiful women. To see it everyday must be a pleasant sight.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi laughed: “This is because Zhimo grew up to look like her mom. If she grew up to look like me, then it won’t be good.”
<br/><br/>
Immediately, there were people flattering: “How can you say that? President Su is clearly attractive. If Zhimo grew to look like you, then it definitely won’t be any worse!” 
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan was originally smiling while she chatted with other people, but when she heard how the group of men were discussing Su Zhimo’s looks, her face instantly became rigid.
<br/><br/>
Not being biologically related, it was only natural that Su Zhimo didn’t inherit Su Chengzhi’s gene and look like him.
<br/><br/>
Someone roared with laughter: “Wasn’t there recently an app that measures how similar the child looks to the parent? After you input you and your madam’s pictures into the app and adjusted the proportion scale, you can see how your generated child look like. If you don’t believe me, go give it a try. See how your children will look if they grow up to look like you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi was very interested: “There are these type of software? Are they accurate?”
　　<br/><br/>
Some people said: “I feel like they are accurate. I used it before and casually set proportion scale. It unexpectedly looked eighty percent like my youngest son! This software is really too impressive!”
<br/><br/>
There were also people who disagreed: “Who can say this is accurate? It was probably made to be amusing.”
　　<br/><br/>
This group of people revolved around the topic of how a child looks without any intention of stopping.
<br/><br/>
Because there was a secret in Xie Yan’s heart, her thoughts were in turmoil as she listened to them talk. As they argue with each other, she became absent-minded to the point it made other people’s expression awkward.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo noticed this and lightly bumped her arm under the table. Her eyes were peaceful.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
“Mom, is your body not feeling well? How come you weren’t listening when the aunties are talking?”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan snapped out of it.
<br/><br/>
After seeing her daughter’s calm expression, she also calmed down.
<br/><br/>
After so many years, Su Chengzhi had never found out. It wasn’t possible for him to suddenly began doubting just because of this small manner.
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan hurriedly gave a gentle apology: “I’m not, I’m not. I suddenly remembered that I had a necklace that I really liked but I forgot where I put it. To actually get distracted, I am really sorry.”
　　<br/><br/>
As expected, the topic about looks quickly went away.
<br/><br/>
The group of men once again revolve around a new topic. Their enthusiasm quickly rise. 
　　<br/><br/>
It was only then that Xie Yan let out a sigh of relief.
　　<br/><br/>
The people sitting around the table were all clients who had collaborated a lot with him before. Very quickly, the company’s Chairman brought a group of senior executives for a toast.
<br/><br/>
When he finished toasting Su Chengzhi, he turned towards Xie Yan and Su Zhimo: “Your wife and daughter have a truly dignified temperament. Just with one look, you can tell——”
　　<br/><br/>
His sentence wasn’t finished before there was a sudden uproar near the door.
<br/><br/>
Everyone’s attention was completely attracted over. The Chairman wrinkled his eyebrows, stopped his compliment, and walked over to the disturbance to see what had happened.
<br/><br/>
Very quickly, someone reported: “Chairman! It’s, it’s President Fu who arrived!”
　　<br/><br/>
The Chairman’s eyes became big: “President Fu——that President Fu?”
<br/><br/>
That person also seemed to not believe it and stammeringly said: “It, it’s that President Fu. Oh, oh, and Qin Family’s grandson.”
　　<br/><br/>
Dropping such big news, the surrounding people can’t help but whisper to each other.
　　<br/><br/>
“What? Fu Shijun? How can he be here? Hasn’t he not participate in these activities for a long time?”
<br/><br/>
“Qin Family’s grandson? That one called Su Zui?”<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
“Correct. I heard that Qin Corporation has already decided to make him the successor.”
　　<br/><br/>
“Chairman Qi really has connections but doesn’t show it. He was actually able to invite two of them together!”
　　<br/><br/>
The Chairman couldn’t believe his ears.
<br/><br/>
Their company’s strength was only stronger than that of the Su Family’s. In the entire A city, it was only considered mid-level.
<br/><br/>
Compared to Qin Family or Fu Family, these top level rich families, the gap was very obvious.
<br/><br/>
While he did send invitations to the two families, but it was already giving them face if their company’s manager came.
　　<br/><br/>
Unexpectedly, two big figures actually came?
　　<br/><br/>
The Chairman carelessly put his wine glass on the table and apologized to the guests: “Pardon me. Pardon me. I will take my leave first.”
<br/><br/>
Once he finished speaking, he walked away: “I will go take a look. I can’t neglect them!”
　　<br/><br/>
Just a second again, Su Chengzhi was the center of everyone’s attention, yet in an instant, no one paid him any attention.
<br/><br/>
He looked at the wine glass on the table. His face cannot help but exposed a slight hint of discontent.
<br/><br/>
After hearing Fu Shijun and Su Zui’s names, his expression became more indescribable.
　　<br/><br/>
Don’t even talk about Su Zui, that heartless white eye wolf.
<br/><br/>
He raised Su Zui till he was an adult. As a result, Su Zui patted his butt and ran back to the Qin Family without having a single regard of him as his elder.
<br/><br/>
Now when people mention him, it was always “Qin Family’s grandson”. Who knows how many people still remember that Su Zui still have a father named Su Chengzhi.
　　<br/><br/>
At first, he had wanted to make friends with Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
But the previous time at Qin Family, this President Fu, who has an outstanding reputation, had a very ordinary attitude towards him. Yet, he was very close with Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
Who knows how he was bewitched by that white eye wolf son of his.
　　<br/><br/>
When Su Zhimo heard that these two people came, her mood also became bad.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
But her expression didn’t show anything. She only shook her head at Su Chengzhi: “Dad, you should quickly sit down.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi sat down with a black face. Taking advantage of the fact no one was paying him any attention, he used a low voice to mumble to himself: “How unlucky!”
<br/><br/>
Yet, the bad luck continued to persist.
　　<br/><br/>
In a few minutes, the Chairman brought the two people over before sitting down in the main seat.
<br/><br/>
No, it was more accurate to say three people.
<br/><br/>
It was only because the third person didn’t have the momentum the other two did that no one mentioned him.
　　<br/><br/>
That person was looked somewhat similar to Fu Shijun, but his appearance was much more loose.
<br/><br/>
This was Fu Shijun’s second brother, Fu Shijing.
　　<br/><br/>
This person was very well-known within the circle.
<br/><br/>
Except it wasn’t the same reputation as his little brother Fu Shijun, where it made many people exclaim with admiration. Instead, his reputation made people gossip. 
　　<br/><br/>
This Fu Shijing was especially fickle. On average, he would change girlfriends every half a month. He had kept countless celebrities, models, and such. 
<br/><br/>
He was almost forty years old, but it was reported that he had no plans for marriage and remained an exotic legend.
　　<br/><br/>
While he was a fickle person through and through, he didn’t do much else.
<br/><br/>
He never struggle for power or caused any trouble for the family. Instead, he conscientiously did his job as a senior executive in the Fu Corporation.
<br/><br/>
Because he played a lot, his relationship with people with a similar taste in the industry was very good. <!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had a high position and power so no one dared to casually chat with him. Su Zui had just recently became Qin Family’s successor so they weren’t familiar with him. As a result, many people conversed with Fu Shijing.
　　<br/><br/>
“Brother Fu, why haven’t you come out to play recently? I already tried inviting you three times but I still haven’t succeeded”
<br/><br/>
“Don’t mention it already. My father’s temper is really big. Every single time he sees me going out, he would always scold me. What can I do? I can only honestly stay at home.”
<br/><br/>
“Haha. Then when Brother Fu finally regains his freedom, you must accept my invitation. I know a recently opened club......”
　　<br/><br/>
The Chairman handed over a glass of wine to Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun easily blocked it and nodded his head: “We will only be here for a while. He will still need to drive in a moment so he can’t drink alcohol today.”
<br/><br/>
The Chairman didn’t dare to insist. These two people coming were already giving their company a very big face. He immediately said: “What President Fu said is right. You shouldn’t drink.”
　　<br/><br/>
As they chatted on one side, the Su Family’s faces were uglier to look at one after the other on the other side.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi pinched his wine glass. He waited half a day yet no one approached him for a drink, causing his mood to become gloomy. He put down the wine glass and ate the food in a depressed manner.
<br/><br/>
The people who were just praising him just now all turned their head and revolved themselves against those three people.
<br/><br/>
This group of opportunist!
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan and Su Zhimo’s mood were more distressed than Su Chengzhi’s mood by a ton.
　　<br/><br/>
Especially Xie Yan. She tightly knead the expensive purse in her hand. Her fingernails dug deep in, almost ripping the exterior surface of the purse.
<br/><br/>
She looked at Fu Shijing, who was smiling and chatting with others, and can only feel a rush of ice cold air rising from her back, making her brain as numb as wood.
　　<br/><br/>
How could Fu Shijing appear here?!
<br/><br/>
Does the Fu Family know something?!
　　<br/><br/>
Is the Fu Family planning on......taking Zhimo away?<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
　　<br/><br/>
If the Fu Family knew that Su Zhimo was Fu Shijing’s child right now, Su Zhimo may be accepted into the Fu Family, but she was already married to Su Chengzhi. The Fu Family will definitely not allow her to enter!
　　<br/><br/>
If there was an opportunity, she planned on relying on the child she had with Fu Shijing to marry into the Fu Family.
<br/><br/>
But that was a plan for the very faraway future.
<br/><br/>
At least before then, she needed to get rid of Su Chengzhi completely.
　　<br/><br/>
“......Madam Su. Madam Su?”
<br/><br/>
Because she was distracted, she wasn’t able to pay attention to the words other people say to her.
<br/><br/>
It was only after someone bumped her arm that she responded. She forcefully smiled: “Ah? What did you say?”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo was also bewildered and uncertain. Her forehead was covered with cold sweat.
<br/><br/>
But she was calmer than Xie Yan. After observing for awhile, she used a low voice to talk into her mother’s ear: “The Fu Family is a famous client......to be here is also very normal.”
<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s eyes messily wandered and tried her best to not reveal any obvious strangeness on her face: “I know. I know.”
　　<br/><br/>
She comforted herself nonstop in her heart.
<br/><br/>
It doesn’t matter. Fu Shijing and her were drunk when that happened. Zhimo also doesn’t look like the Fu Family.
<br/><br/>
Nothing had happened for so many years. This was only a chance encounter. The Fu Family definitely will not doubt anything.
　　<br/><br/>
Then as if he wanted to prove her wrong, Fu Shijing, who was originally happily chatting with other people, suddenly turned to look at them due of an unknown comment.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing gave her a smile: “Madam Xie looks really beautiful.”
　　<br/><br/>
Xie Yan’s mouth was almost tongue-tied. She didn’t dare look at him. She can only hung her head and absent-mindedly say: “Thank, thank you.”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing gave a haha laugh, but his words didn’t have a single trace of friendliness: “If I was President Su, I will definitely also be unable to resist Madam Xie’s charm. Maybe I could have waited for something to happen to my first wife before taking Madam Xie back home.”
　　<br/><br/>
Once his words were said, the whole table became silent.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
Because of Su Zui’s arrival, Su Chengzhi’s whole family’s position was already very awkward.
<br/><br/>
With Fu Shijing saying such unrelenting words, it was simply tearing the last of Su Family’s face.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Chengzhi’s face became the color of pig liver. Both his eyes became red: “You——”
<br/><br/>
After stopping at “you” for half a day, he was ultimately unable to continue.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing’s backing was the Fu Family. There was still a Fu Shijin sitting by his side. If he were to dare say something ugly to Fu Shijing, then he will be put in an awkward spot.
<br/><br/>
That’s why even though Fu Shijing pointed in his face and mock him, he can’t say anything back.
　　<br/><br/>
On the other side, Xie Yan’s face was deathly white, as if she were about to faint!
<br/><br/>
She practically could not dare to believe her ears. To be humiliated in front of so many people by her daughter’s biological father, just what is this?
　　<br/><br/>
Maybe in the view of others, Fu Shijing was only interested in mocking how the mistress rose in position for a brief moment.
<br/><br/>
While it was awkward, but this type of things weren’t uncommon. What had passed has already passed. There won’t be anyone who will truly seize this point and not let go.
　　<br/><br/>
It was only Xie Yan and Su Zhimo who knew the truth. Their hearts were more unbearable compared to not eating food for three days.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing casually laughed again: “Ai. My personality was always frank and outspoken. I don’t mean anything by it. If I said anything wrong, I hope President Su and Madam Xie won’t plot against me.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing observed how Xie Yan and Su Zhimo were about to be angered to death. His heart actually felt a bit puzzled.
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
He didn’t go that out of line. He had only mocked them once.
<br/><br/>
Why did this mother and daughter pair immediately looked like they will die here from indignant? Don’t tell him they are prepared to bump porcelain<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a>.
　　<br/><br/>
He silently labeled them as crazy before gently coughing and quickly started chatting with other people.
<br/><br/>
Coming from a rich family, his words were originally not supposed to be this distasteful. 
<br/><br/>
But being a playboy from a rich family, what distasteful stuff had he not done before? This was not excluded from the list.
　　<br/><br/>
Didn’t his little brother ordered him to come to this type of small banquet because he wanted him to use his loose mouth to do work?
<br/><br/>
While Fu Shijing may be incapable of doing other things, but he can still tell this much.
　　<br/><br/>
He used the corner of his eyes to observe Fu Shijun pouring a drink for Su Zui. The more he looked, the more he felt that the atmosphere between the two wasn’t quite right.
　　<br/><br/>
Not only did he brought him over for this childish matter only to vent anger for Qin Family’s small successor, but he also personally poured a drink for the other.
<br/><br/>
Being Fu Shijun’s biological older brother for more than ten years, he had never seen this type of scene before!
　　<br/><br/>
Don’t tell him this slow-witted little brother of his was really about to start flowering......
　　<br/><br/>
But wasn’t the age gap between his little brother and this child a bit awkward?
　　<br/><br/>
His dad and Su Zui’s grandfather are best friends. The two of them were from the same generation and had been friends for more than several dozens of years.
<br/><br/>
If his little brother and Su Zui really got together, then his whole family will carry the Qin Family for a lifetime for no reason because of Fu Shijun.
　　<br/><br/>
They young people don’t really care about the family hierarchy or whatnot, but the elders in the family wanted face regardless of life or death.
<br/><br/>
After they know about this matter, they will definitely be surprised as if there was thunder on a clear day.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijing can’t resist laughing from other people’s misfortune in his heart.
<br/><br/>
The old man was finally getting his retribution after using his status as an elder to lecture him everyday.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun didn’t care what he was thinking. He looked and Su Zui and asked in a low voice: “Is your mood better?”
<br/><br/>
Ever since he told Su Zui about Su Zhimo’s origins, he always felt that his small friend was colder whenever he interacted with Su Zui.
　　<br/><br/>
His mouth said he’s not angry, but reality shown differently.<!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
<br/><br/>
It really was like the temperament of a kitty.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun was a romance novice. When he became known of his feelings, he was originally meant to be hesitant or be at a loss.
<br/><br/>
Not only may he be hesitant or confused, but he may choose to retreat after he considered each and every obstacle in his way.
<br/><br/>
But as a result of Su Zui’s sudden cold attitude, he didn’t have time to think about the messy stuff. Instead, he fretted over how to make his small friend happy again everyday.
　　<br/><br/>
Towards the matter of himself loving Su Zui, not only did he accept it, but also became even more certain of his feelings.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun thought about it for half a day before finally thinking up a rather childish method.
<br/><br/>
While it was temporarily not a good time to deal with Su Zhimo, but to make the members of the Su Family suffer a loss and disgrace them was still very easy to achieve. 
　　<br/><br/>
If it was himself, he will definitely disdain using this method to retaliate against his enemies.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui wasn’t the same.
<br/><br/>
He was still young and has a childish temperament. If he saw how the people he dislikes became misfortunate, his mood may become better.
　　<br/><br/>
The family wasn’t the important point.
<br/><br/>
From start to end, his goal was to coax his small friend’s mood to be better.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui obediently held the cup of orange juice and honestly said: “It’s a bit better.”
　　<br/><br/>
He was too lazy to waste this much energy to cause damage to those inexperienced family members.
<br/><br/>
But since Fu Shijun already did all the busy work, he doesn’t mind enjoying how those people’s expression after they had been publicly condemned.
　　<br/><br/>
The only problem is——
<br/><br/><!--This work has been translated by Cloral, please do not repost-->
Su Zui looked at the unmoving 40% attack completion progress on the mission board and was at a loss.
<br/><br/>
He already consciously distanced himself from the boss for half a month. How can the small favorable impression Fu Shijun had of him risen so much?
　　<br/><br/>
The 4000 experience points the mission gave him always felt like it was earned by selling his body. It made him unable to spend it.
　　<br/><br/>
