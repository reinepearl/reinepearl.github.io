								The atmosphere suddenly became deadly silent.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun quickly discovered the other person’s existence.
<br/><br/>
That green face was too obvious. He was able to quickly guess that this man, who was looking at him with ill intent, and his small friend, who was laying on his chest and didn’t seem to know his place, recognized each other.
<br/><br/>
Can’t say for sure, but the two may have came here to eat today.
　　<br/><br/>
So this is him——being taken as a male adulterer?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun had lived this long. He had competed with people twice his age in the business world right after he graduated, what big winds and waves<a href = "#footnote1bottom" id = "footnote1top">(1)</a> had he not experience?
<br/><br/>
Except because his barren love life, he actually never experienced this type of strange situation.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s heart suddenly felt uncomfortable.
<br/><br/>
He quickly classified that feeling as annoyance of being roped into a strange situation.
　　<br/><br/>
He didn’t like discussing emotions because it was too troublesome.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s furrowed brows became deeper.
<br/><br/>
Just when he was planning to let go of Su Zui, he suddenly felt his arm became heavier.
　　<br/><br/>
The small child who was impatient to get away from his just a moment ago suddenly acted out of character and grabbed him.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun paused in releasing him, and lowered his head to look at the youth, who was shorter than him by a head.
　　<br/><br/>
The youth’s face was deathly white, but his expression didn’t show any signs of weakness.
<br/><br/>
Only the hand that suddenly grabbed his arm leaked a clue.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s hand that was originally going to retract, once again laid on Su Zui’s shoulder.
<br/><br/>
While it was annoying to be roped into this strange situation, but with the way how Su Zui looked as if he would fall down at any time, if he really left without doing anything and was found out by his family’s elder, then for half a month, he won’t be able to get any peace and quiet.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun patted his back to pacify him and asked: “Go to the hospital first?”
<br/><br/>
He doesn’t remember how long it had been since he was this patient.
<br/><br/>
Don’t know what Su Zui was thinking about, but after a moment, he quietly said: “Sorry for troubling you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Scum male, the original, and the neighboring uncle.
<br/><br/>
Actually, this can be considered a battlefield setting. 
<br/><br/>
Yet the regrettable thing was, other than Yang Yuanhang, the two people who seemed to be having an affair didn’t treat this seriously.
　　<br/><br/>
Even though Fu Shijun felt somewhat displeased, but Yang Yuanhang, this type of small character, to him was no different from the ants found along the street.
<br/><br/>
Even if this ant’s looks were enough to provoke a person’s loathing, it wasn’t sufficient enough to give him a second glance.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui polished his moneymaking plan: “So it turns out making Yang Yuanhang wear the green hat can also be considered completing the mission.”
<br/><br/>
This conclusion seemed right. Yang Yuanhang and Su Zhimo being mixed together made the original wear a big green hat. Now that he properly sent the green hat back, wasn’t this considered as “making the scum male obtaining his deserved retribution”?
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang definitely misunderstood. In this world, there is no one cleaner than him and Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
But Su Zui didn’t intend to clear up this misunderstanding.
<br/><br/>
Not only did he not plan on not clearing it up, he planned on letting Yang Yuanhang misunderstand more and smash the truth.
　　<br/><br/>
Realizing this, his whole body leaned a bit closer to Fu Shijun’s direction, nearly leaning on the man’s body once again.
<br/><br/>
While he doesn’t want to be too close to the boss, but special circumstances calls for special responses.
<br/><br/>
Them doing the mission to earn money, can it be call exploitation?
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui looked at the one thousand experience points in his account. As if obtaining a cheat, he even felt that Fu Shijun’s intense invasive aura no longer made him feel unwell.
<br/><br/>
So much that he felt the perfume Fu Shijun sprayed on today doesn’t smell too bad; as if once smelled, the person can get rich quickly.
<br/><br/>
He tightly held onto Fu Shijun’s arm, like he was holding a moving ATM.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun considerately embraced him by the shoulders and carried Su Zui as if he suddenly received a heavy injury towards the exit.
　　<br/><br/>
Seeing how the two people were leaving in a romantic manner as if nothing happened, Yang Yuanhang can’t hold back anymore and stepped one step toward them, blocking the two, his face full of anger.
<br/><br/>
“You guys——”
　　<br/><br/>
The “guys” word wasn’t even finished before Fu Shijun’s coldly looked over and scare him to the point of silence.
　　<br/><br/>
While Fu Shijun was only older than Yang Yuanhang by a few years, but due to seating at the top for such a long time, their temperaments were as different as day and night.
<br/><br/>
So much that he doesn’t even need to speak; just by giving him a warning glance was like pouring a bucket of ice cold water onto Yang Yuanhang’s head, making him cold to the point he lost his ability to speak.
　　<br/><br/>
The invisible pressure made Yang Yuanhang seemed like green headed duck who was pinched at the neck, foolishly standing there.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui closed his eyes halfway and leaned on the tall man’s shoulder, not speaking to him from beginning to the end.
　　<br/><br/>
After the two went away for two minutes, Yang Yuanhang finally recovered.
<br/><br/>
He stumbled back a few steps and steadied himself using the wall.
　　<br/><br/>
It was very hard to describe this sensation.
<br/><br/>
The instance their gazes met, he felt himself becoming an insect.
<br/><br/>
As long as the man was willing, the man can crush him without any trouble.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang had never went through such a clear-headed realization. Even if he climbed up with all his might, the gap between him and this type of human was like heaven and sky.
<br/><br/>
That aloof and remote aura was built from one’s appearance, wealth, and influence.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang breathed roughly; the rim of his eyes were red from anger.
<br/><br/>
They are both men. Being crushed from head to toe, his heart was naturally full of humiliation. 
<br/><br/>
Remembering how intimate Su Zui leaned against that person’s chest, another batch of anger spurted out. He lost his reasoning and rushed at the cubicle and gave the unclosed door left by Su Zui when he left the restroom a kick.
　　<br/><br/>
The door and wall hit each other, creating a loud kuang dang noise.
<br/><br/>
The neighboring door was harder than he thought. Yang Yuanhang impulsively kicked his foot. In an instant, his whole foot became numb, painful enough to warp his face, bent his waist, and released a “Ssss” sound.
<br/><br/>
Don’t know which neighboring room suddenly transmitted an angry male voice: “Cao! Scared me to death! Where did this fool come from! Making kuang kuang kuang noises in the restroom, are they sick?! Just you wait, once you come out I’m going to put you to death!”
　　<br/><br/>
This voice was very aggressive. Clearly this wasn’t the first time they threatened people. Yang Yuanhang’s stomping froze.
<br/><br/>
The people who dined in this place, most of them are wealthy and respectable people.
<br/><br/>
No matter who it was, he can’t afford to offend them.
　　<br/><br/>
The waiter who was chasing him for the bill also saw this scene and his face also became unsightly: “Sorry for the inconvenience Sir. Please do not break public facilities or disturb other guests. If you continue to behave this way, our restaurant will call the police.”
<br/><br/>
“Also, please pay the bill as quickly as possible.”
　　<br/><br/>
Remembering that bill that was definitely not lower than five digits, Yang Yuanhang’s face became green once more.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph2">
Once they arrived at the parking lot, Su Zui quickly removed his hand from Fu Shijun’s arm.
<br/><br/>
At the same time, his waist bend and nimbly bore himself out of Fu Shijun’s chest.
　　<br/><br/>
His nose finally wasn’t engulfed by a certain person’s smell. Su Zui let out a breath.
<br/><br/>
He raised his head and very considerately said: “Uncle Fu, I’m feeling much better. You don’t need to send me to the hospital. Here is fine. I can drive myself back.”
　　<br/><br/>
And once again, he seems to be eager to distance himself away.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun looked at Su Zui standing three steps away from himself and suddenly had a subtle misconception that he had just been played wtih and thrown away.
<br/><br/>
He stared at Su Zui with fixed eyes. Before his eyes, a heartless kitty suddenly appeared. After rubbing against him and eating his dry fish, it right away raised its tail and ran away to one side, turning its back and using all its strength to shake its fur.
　　<br/><br/>
Because he was able to earn a big amount of money due to the other, Su Zui was currently very patient with the boss. Not only did he not angry once he saw Fu Shijun didn’t speak, he instead said in a cheerful tone: “Don’t you have guests waiting for you? Don’t delay your business.”
　　<br/><br/>
The lights in the dark were very beautiful.
<br/><br/>
But compared to the bright daytime, the dark night time gives people a more ambiguous feel.
<br/><br/>
The youth before his eyes have a good outward appearance.
<br/><br/>
He looks obedient, and when he laughs, the cheeks will reveal faint dimples, as if it will make people drunk and die there<a href = "#footnote2bottom" id = "footnote2top">(2)</a>.
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun expressionlessly spit out three words: “To the hospital.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui’s smile gradually faded: “......”
　　<br/><br/>
In the end, he persuaded for a long time before finally dispelling the idea of sending him to the hospital from this boss’s head.
<br/><br/>
Except he lost his power to drive his own car back home.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun demanded to personally send him home, and only then can he feel reassured.
　　<br/><br/>
Throughout the whole journey, the two didn’t make any conversation.
<br/><br/>
While both sat in the back row, but there was a two person space between them, and could only come in contact if one extended their arm.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui lowered his head and quietly pressed his cellphone.
<br/><br/>
He brought out the messages the original send to Yang Yuanhang, selected each one, and pressed delete.
　<br/><br/>
The original send Yang Yuanhang a lot of messages. All the messages were without exception send out of one’s own will in an enthusiastic manner.
<br/><br/>
Through these words, it was as if he can see the expectation and joy when original send out these messages.
<br/><br/>
Yet Yang Yuanhang’s replies were not only lacking, but each message also carried a cold and aloof tone.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang was the model of a white eye wolf.
<br/><br/>
The only thing that enters his eyes are forever things beneficial to himself.
　　<br/><br/>
His appearance just now in the restroom, it was apparent that he was feeling very uncomfortable.
<br/><br/>
But Yang Yuanhang was the same as being blind and was completely unable to see his discomfort. He was only able to see him and another man embracing each other in an ambiguous manner.
<br/><br/>
Not even bother to think if it was because he wasn’t able to stand steadily that he asked another person for help.
　　<br/><br/>
After Su Zui finished erasing all the records that hurt his eyes and because there was nothing to do, he went to observe the neighboring boss’s ecology.
<br/><br/>
From the beginning to end, Fu Shijun maintained his cultivated overbearing president and boss’s cold face. From time to time, he will make a call to another person or use his cellphone to check his email with a concentrated expression.
<br/><br/>
Even though he was sitting in the car, he didn’t stay idle.
<br/><br/>
Being president wasn’t all that great. If one wants to be successful, even if the starting point was high, one still needs to steadily handle matters.
<br/><br/>
Being light-headed due to the constant studying from the past few days, Su Zui felt moved towards this.
　　<br/><br/>
As if sensing his gaze, Fu Shijun suddenly raised his head and gave him a glance: “What is it? Feeling uncomfortable?”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui was afraid his next sentence could tell the driver to turn around and go to the hospital, and hurriedly answered: “I’m not I’m not!”
<br/><br/>
Actually there were a bit of pain, but he wasn’t that delicate and recovered a long time ago.
　　<br/><br/>
But Fu Shijun looked like he cared about this alot.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui suddenly felt that the boss was actually a very good person. Regardless whether it stemmed from family relations or what, to be able to be that concerned about him, that itself was already very hard.
<br/><br/>
He shouldn’t have that big of a prejudice against Fu Shijun.
<br/><br/>
Probably due to the change in heart, the more Su Zui watched Fu Shijun’s cold face, the more he felt that his face has the words “kindhearted” written on it.
<br/><br/>
Of course——the main reason was because of the one thousand experience points contribution just now.
　　<br/><br/>
Under this friendly atmosphere, Fu Shijun suddenly extended his cellphone towards Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: ?
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun’s face didn’t change: “Exchange WeChat.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
Sure, why reject a free connection.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui skillfully exchanged WeChat with Fu Shijun, and added him as a friend.
<br/><br/>
Just like that, he forgot his resolute decision of “if he doesn’t need to be in contact with the boss, then don’t be in contact” in the beginning.
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph3">
Ever since that day Su Zui and Su Chengzhi fell out, Su Zui never returned to Su family.
<br/><br/>
He moved to Qin family and live together with Grandfather Qin.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui originally wanted to say that sending him to the district’s doorway was fine, but Fu Shijun didn’t give him any opportunities to resist, and simply send him all the way to Grandfather Qin.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin saw him and felt very shocked: “Shijun, why are you here? Did…...did Xiao Zui give you trouble?”
<br/><br/>
Actually, it wasn’t that he had any prejudice against his own grandson; rather, the Su Zui from before actually never made progress to improve himself.
<br/><br/>
While there was some changes recently, but compared to “other family’s child” Fu Shijun’s talent, Grandfather Qin inevitably still have this line of thought. 
　　<br/><br/>
On the contrary, Fu Shijun didn’t tattletale: “No, Xiao Zui was pretty obedient.”
<br/><br/>
He pushed Su Zui forward a bit: “It seems that his stomach problem acted up, so his body isn’t feeling well. It was by chance that I was passing by so I’m sending him home along the way.”
<br/><br/>
“You should pay more attention. If a doctor can come take a look, you should get it looked at.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun still haven’t given up on the idea of him being checked by a doctor?
<br/><br/>
This spirit is also awesome.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin suddenly became nervous: “Does it hurt? I’ll call for the doctor to have them take a look.”
<br/><br/>
Towards Grandfather Qin, Su Zui completely didn’t have the vigor of talking back like he did to Fu Shijun and can only helplessly explain: “It already doesn’t hurt. It’s already so late. It’s better not to bother the doctor.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun suddenly uttered: “It’s only ten o’clock.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zui: “......”
<br/><br/>
The boss was going to make him die from anger.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin made the final decision: “The body is important. Letting the doctor to come have a look won’t cause anything.”
<br/><br/>
He looked towards Fu Shijun: “Shijun, do you want to stay behind and eat dinner? Today we troubled you.”
　　<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun: “I just ate. It’s already late so I won’t be disturbing. I’ll head back first. You should pay attention to your health.”
<br/><br/>
After finish speaking, he directly left, not giving Grandfather Qin any chance to send him off.
<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin knew his personality was like this, and also didn’t insist. 
　　<br/><br/>
After Fu Shijun left, the doctor quickly arrived.
<br/><br/>
After looking over Su Zui, he didn’t discover any big problem and only instructed a few sentences of need to eat lightly, get more rest, these type of banal words.
　　<br/><br/>
Grandfather Qin: “Your Uncle Fu is very talented. Since he likes you, you don’t need to be polite and should ask him for guidance more often.”
<br/><br/>
He can sense that his body for the past few years were becoming more and more worse, and also don’t know how much longer he can help Su Zui.
<br/><br/>
Right now, he can still guide this grandson. After he leaves, Su Zui will truly be all alone.
　　<br/><br/>
The thing he can do right now is to use this time to help him accumulate more connections so if something happens in the future, there will be someone to help him.
　　<br/><br/>
Facing this constantly worrying elder, Su Zui also can’t say anything unpleasant and can only obediently nod: “En. You don’t need to worry.”
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui drank the small bowl of porridge that Grandfather Qin stuffed to him, took a shower, and laid on the bed, joyfully opening the system market.
<br/><br/>
He can finally buy artifacts!
　<br/><br/>
Within a few minutes, Su Zui became silent.
<br/><br/>
One thousand something experience points looked like a lot, but the price of things in the system market weren’t cheap.
<br/><br/>
The artifact capable of upgrading the body’s constitution costs six hundred experience points for one.
<br/><br/>
He was urgent to give this to Grandfather Qin to use so he won’t be able to use it for himself.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui bought an upgrade body constitution artifact for Grandfather and listlessly closed the system market.
<br/><br/>
The four hundred leftover experience points, he’ll leave them as reserves.
　　<br/><br/>
He had just finished turning off the light and go to sleep when his cellphone suddenly lit up.
<br/><br/>
Fu Shijun send a text: [Did you get a doctor to look over you?]
<br/><br/>
Remembering Grandfather Qin’s command to have a good connection with Fu Shijun, Su Zui suffered in silence and replied: [Already looked over. There was nothing wrong. Thank you for the concern.]
<br/><br/>
At the same time, he changed the boss’s name.
　　<br/><br/>
The annoying spirit next door: [En. Go rest early.]
</p>
<br/><br/><center>————————</center>
<br/><br/><p id = "contentParagraph4">
Su Zui slept without worries. Yang Yuanhang’s day didn’t progress smoothly.
<br/><br/>
First, he was scolded harshly by the rich second generation after he rushed out from the toilet, then he had to pay a five digit bill. His hands were trembling as he was driving home.
　　<br/><br/>
Arriving home, he once again received Su Zhimo’s inquiry.
　　<br/><br/>
According to the plan, this should be the time Su Zui became embarrassed and went to shower.
<br/><br/>
Yet reality is…...
　　<br/><br/>
Remembering how Su Zui was carried by that feral man, Yang Yuanhang can only feel that he has a green cloud covering his head.
<br/><br/>
Saying that his work was more important, he actually thought that Su Zui really changed, but in the end it was actually an excuse to fool around with people outside?!
　　<br/><br/>
When he was chasing him, the words sounded all pretty. Things like will marry him or will not cheat or wrong him at home.
<br/><br/>
He only persisted for a few months and already forgotten those promises! One moment he rejected going home with him, another moment he left with another man right in front of his face!
<br/><br/>
Did he think he was an idiot?
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang laughed coldly in his heart.
<br/><br/>
He originally cared about Su Zui’s regards for him. He had thought to part from Su Zui without any hard feelings by leaving right after finishing the things he promised Su Zhimo.
<br/><br/>
But reality ruthlessly gave him a huge slap in the face.
　　<br/><br/>
Yang Yuanhang stalled for a while before replying back to Su Zhimo: “A mishap happened. I’ll try again in a few days.”
<br/><br/>
Remembering that man with the threatening aura, Yang Yuanhang quickly added: “There was a man who took him away. His position was high and shouldn’t to be trifled with. He probably recognized him. I didn’t manage to obstruct him. You should watch out.”
<br/><br/>
That side waited a while before replying: “Ok.”
<br/><br/>
Su Zhimo put down her cellphone.
　　<br/><br/>
She seldomly wrinkled her eyebrows.
<br/><br/>
The plan actually didn’t succeed?
<br/><br/>
To prevent any accidents, she had wasted a big effort in persuading her classmate who works in Hua Shi to drop the stuff into Su Zui’s drink.
<br/><br/>
For insurance, even Yang Yuanhang didn’t know about this.
　　<br/><br/>
Su Zui droop her eyes and looked at the mirror to observe her delicate face, her face flashed with melancholy. 
<br/><br/>
What made her concerned was that man Yang Yuanhang mentioned.
　　<br/><br/>
Without reason, Fu Shijun’s face suddenly popped up in her brain.
<br/><br/>
She had always have an accurate intuition.
　　<br/><br/>
Not only intuition.
<br/><br/>
Ever since she can remember, her luck has always been exceptionally good.
<br/><br/>
So long as she wants something, not too long after, it will smoothly fall into her hands.
<br/><br/>
The majority of the people around her, whether male, female, elder, or young, all are incapable of resisting her charm. They would always be there for her beck and call and work hard without complaint.
　　<br/><br/>
The days that went smoothly, she already doesn’t remember how that felt like.
<br/><br/>
That awkwardness experienced at the banquet a few days ago made her unable to dispel it for quite a long time.
<br/><br/>
That Young Master Xu who said he will take her to ride horses haven’t contacted her ever since.
<br/><br/>
Her good luck recently seems to have lost its effectiveness.
　　<br/><br/>
At what time did things start not going right?
<br/><br/>
It seemed to be that day, when that antisocial stepbrother of hers pointed at her mother at the dining table and called her a mistress.
<br/><br/>
